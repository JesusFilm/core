# Object Tracking Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement scene-aware object tracking system that maintains unique IDs for detected objects (faces, people, objects) within each scene, clearing tracking history when scene changes are detected.

## Architecture Components
- **Scene Detection**: Identify when scenes change
- **Object Tracking State**: Maintain persistent object identities within scenes
- **Visual Feedback**: Display unique IDs and tracking information
- **Auto-Tracking Integration**: Use tracked objects for improved crop following

- [ ] Console shows "Scene change detected - clearing tracking"

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### ✅ 2.2 Visual Tracking Feedback
**Goal**: Display unique IDs on detection boxes

**Implementation:**
- Add unique ID labels to green detection boxes
- Color-code different tracked objects
- Show tracking confidence and persistence time

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Update `crop-workspace.tsx` to display tracking IDs
- Add ID labels and color coding to detection overlays
- Style tracked objects differently from untracked detections

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Green boxes show unique tracking IDs (T-001, T-002, etc.)
- [ ] Different objects have different colors
- [ ] IDs persist across frames for same object
- [ ] New scene resets ID numbering

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

- [ ] Console shows match confidence scores

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### ✅ 3.2 Auto-Tracking Integration
