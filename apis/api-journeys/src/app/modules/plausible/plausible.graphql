  This endpoint allows you to break down your stats by some property.
  If you are familiar with SQL family databases, this endpoint corresponds to
  running `GROUP BY` on a certain property in your stats, then ordering by the
  count.
  Check out the [properties](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#properties)
  section for a reference of all the properties you can use in this query.
  This endpoint can be used to fetch data for `Top sources`, `Top pages`,
  `Top countries` and similar reports.
  Currently, it is only possible to break down on one property at a time.
  Using a list of properties with one query is not supported. So if you want
  a breakdown by both `event:page` and `visit:source` for example, you would
  have to make multiple queries (break down on one property and filter on
  another) and then manually/programmatically group the results together in one
  report. This also applies for breaking down by time periods. To get a daily
  breakdown for every page, you would have to break down on `event:page` and
  make multiple queries for each date.
