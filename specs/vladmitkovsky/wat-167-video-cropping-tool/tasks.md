# Tasks: Vertical Video Crop Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/vladmitkovsky/wat-167-video-cropping-tool/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, ffmpeg.wasm, MediaPipe Tasks Vision
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 5 entities (Video, CropKeyframe, CropPath, DetectionResult, ExportPreset)
   → contracts/: 3 API endpoints (search, get video, export)
   → research.md: WebAssembly integration patterns, detection algorithms
   → quickstart.md: 5 test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Nx app creation, dependencies, shadcn/ui setup
   → Tests: 3 contract tests, 5 integration tests
   → Core: 5 model types, 8 components, Web Worker setup
   → Integration: API integration, ffmpeg.wasm, MediaPipe detection
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify all tests fail before implementing any functionality
- Commit after each completed task for proper git history
- Follow TDD: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- Use exact file paths as specified in tasks
- Ensure 9:16 aspect ratio constraints in all crop operations
- Implement smooth keyframe interpolation for professional results
- Handle WebAssembly loading gracefully with user feedback
- Maintain 60fps UI responsiveness during video processing
- Follow accessibility guidelines for keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Task Generation Rules Applied
*Applied during task generation process*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - video-api.yaml → 3 contract test tasks [P]
   - video-api.contract.spec.ts → integration test patterns
   - Each API endpoint → corresponding implementation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 5 entities → 5 TypeScript type definition tasks [P]
   - Entity relationships → validation and service layer tasks
   - State management entities → React hook tasks

3. **From Research**:
   - ffmpeg.wasm patterns → Web Worker and export pipeline tasks
   - MediaPipe integration → detection worker and algorithm tasks
   - Browser optimizations → performance and compatibility tasks

4. **From Quickstart**:
   - 5 test scenarios → 5 integration test tasks [P]
   - Performance targets → performance test tasks
   - Accessibility requirements → polish tasks

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Types → Validation → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies enforced through task numbering and prerequisites

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task generation completion*

- [x] All 3 contracts have corresponding test tasks (T007-T009)

- [x] All tests come before implementation (T007-T014 before T015-T039)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different file paths)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Dependencies properly ordered by phase and prerequisites
- [x] Task count appropriate for feature scope (55 total tasks)
- [x] Technical decisions from research.md incorporated
- [x] Quickstart scenarios covered in test tasks
