# Core Unified Product Suite

Core is Jesus Film Project's modern, developer-friendly solution that makes building large, feature-rich javascript projects painless. It contains all the tools you need to start building modern react applications ontop of robust GraphQL APIs, using battle-tested front-end and back-end development tools and practices.

## Features

- **Deploy new applications quickly**. All of our Cloud deployment details are contained within Core making provisioning new resources as quick and easy as raising a Pull Request. We use Terraform to plan and apply changes to cloud infrastructure.
- **Robust Continuous Integration**. Testing everything automatically results in a workflow where we can move fast without breaking things.
- **Monorepo - One source of truth**. Frontend and backend projects are deployed from the same place in the same language - Typescript. We can leverage this to strongly type our frontends to ensure smooth backend changes. Our monorepo allows us to benefit from shared components, infrastructure, libraries across our projects.

## Getting Started

The fastest and easiest way to try Core out is via using Visual Studio Code with the Remote - Containers extension. This lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment.
