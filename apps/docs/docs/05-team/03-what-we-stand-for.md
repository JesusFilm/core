# What We Stand For

We want everyone, everywhere to encounter Jesus. We believe film is the most dynamic way to hear and see the greatest story ever lived -- so we are driven to bring Christ-centered video to the ends of the earth. More than 490 million people have come to Jesus after watching these films! We’ve set an ambitious goal of **reaching 1 billion unreached people annually by 2025**, but we need your help. You, your work, your ideas, your faith, will be a critical element that makes this goal a reality!

## Values

Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything’s harder when we all believe different things about what’s important to _us_, our team.

### Who we are

- **We honor Christ and our teammates with integrity.**
  If we live with integrity, nothing else matters. If we don't live with integrity, nothing else matters. This creates openness and trust. It is related to how you treat people driving us to have honesty in our conversations, showing that we value their feelings. This kind of grace and truth builds trust within our team.

  > The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. - John 1:14

- **We always bring our best.**
  Excellence honors God and inspires people.

  > So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. - 1 Corinthians 10:31

- **We are faith-filled, big-thinking, bet-the-farm risk takers.**
  We'll never insult God with small thinking and safe living because God owns all the farms. We should be willing to fail, test, learn and repeat.

- **We are fearlessly unconventional to reach people who don’t know Christ.**
  In order to reach people no one is reaching, we'll have to do things no one is doing. We are called to reach people who don’t know Christ. It is who we are.

### How we do it

- **We do things WITH partners in the field, not on our OWN for the field.**
  Partners are saying "don't do anything for us without us".

- **We choose our partners’ success and ministry success over Organizational brand success.**
  Our partners aren’t doing this for us, their ministry success is ultimately our success, so we help them without imposing our needs on their efforts.

- **We don’t get stuck because of edge cases and what we did before. We prioritize solving today’s real problems for customers.**
  We are willing to be driven by the real needs of today’s audiences.

- **We give up things we love for things we love even more.**
  It's an honor to sacrifice for Christ and His church. We are passionate about this, as such it should not feel like a sacrifice. We can fall in love with our piece of the work, but we've got to be willing to let go when others show us a better way.

  > Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. - Philippians 2:1-2
