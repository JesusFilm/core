# What We Stand For

## Sharing the story of Jesus

We want everyone, everywhere to encounter Jesus. We believe film is the most dynamic way to hear and see the greatest story ever lived -- so we are driven to bring Christ-centered video to the ends of the earth. More than 490 million people have come to Jesus after watching these films! We’ve set an ambitious goal of **reaching 1 billion unreached people annually by 2025**, but we need your help. You, your work, your ideas, your faith, will be a critical element that makes this goal a reality!

## Values

Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything’s harder when we all believe different things about what’s important to _us_, our team.

Key values:

- **Be Straightforward.** Whenever we speak - internally or externally - we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn’t mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but it’s got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Don’t use eight words when five will do.

- **Be fair and do the right thing.** What’s fair? What’s the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone’s judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is "what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help?" An example might be being someone who says ’Sure we can do that for you’ when a user expected you to say ’sorry, we can’t.’ If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it.

- **Levelheadedness**. We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don’t act out of spite, we don’t rush to judgment, we don’t jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly - directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure.

- **Generosity.** Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure - we give what we’re expected to, and then some.
