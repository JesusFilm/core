# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an inclusive and safe workplace, Jesus Film pledges to be a harassment- and discrimination-free space for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, nationality, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, or race.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a healthy environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful and empathetic when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting and offering constructive criticism and feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior by employees include:

- The use of any sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Insulting or derogatory comments
- Discriminating on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, nationality, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, or race.
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Managers are responsible for upholding these standards. They will be clear and equitable when applying standards of acceptable behavior. They’re required to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. If you have questions about the standards above, talk to your manager or to Marc.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within Jesus Film during work hours and in public spaces when you’re representing Jesus Film. Examples of representing Jesus Film in a public space include acting as a delegate at an online or offline event like a conference, posting on Jesus Film branded social media, or participating in a Jesus Film social event outside of work hours.

## Enforcement

If you notice someone acting inappropriately as described in the standards above, you can report it by contacting your manager or Marc.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is appropriate to the circumstances. Managers are required maintain your confidentiality however you choose to report an incident.

After your complaint has been reviewed, investigated, and responded to, Marc or your manager will inform you of the steps being taken to address the original issue and any disciplinary outcomes.

In addition, all valid complaints about employees will be documented in a permanent file, along with related investigation processes and disciplinary outcomes. Repeated complaints about one employee will result in escalating disciplinary measures, up to and including termination.

Managers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith will be subject to corrective action as well.
