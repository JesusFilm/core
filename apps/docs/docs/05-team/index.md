# Employee Handbook

Welcome to the Jesus Film Solutions Team. This is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about Jesus Film the organization, our culture, our process, and our history. This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a team. What do we stand for? How should we work?

Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the team our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”.

Many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.

If you’re reading this just after joining the team, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with Jesus Film for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.
