# Our Team Is You

Everyone working in the Jesus Film Product Solutions Team represents Jesus Film. When someone gets a response from Matt on support, Matt is Jesus Film. When a customer reads a tweet by Tatai that our systems are down, Tatai is Jesus Film. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.

That’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the doing things like [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

The vast majority of our users come from word-of-mouth and much of that word comes from our global staff and connected networks. This is an audience we’ve been connecting with for over 40 years, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not! Tell us and our audience what you have to say!

It’s also worth mentioning that joining Jesus Film can be all-consuming. We’ve seen it happen. You are excited about the vision and mission of Jesus Film, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are super passionate about making Jesus known, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here’s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We’re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it’s a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We’ll all be better for it.
