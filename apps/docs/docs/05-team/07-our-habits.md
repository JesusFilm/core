# Our Habits

## Meetups

Once a year, our team gathers at a ministry hub for a week. Your first meet-up will be overwhelming; there are a lot of people to meet, most or all of whom you’ve only chatted with virtually. People tend to arrive on the Sunday before the meet-up, but ’campers who travel longer distances arrive earlier to beat the jet lag. Jesus Film books accomodation nearby, so you don’t need to worry about finding a place to stay.

Every morning, we gather for breakfast at 8am, and sessions start around 9am. The meet-up is not structured. There are some scheduled talks - Marc and Aaron generally talk about the state of the organization on Monday or Tuesday morning, and other Jesus Filmers may want to give a talk about a special circumstance they’ve seen in the past 6 months. Occasionally, we bring in outside speakers, too. But, day-to-day, the meet-up is very loosely scheduled. Teams work together in a room at the office; people go out for coffee or ice cream; managers schedule one-on-ones with employees.

Lunch is also shared in the office at noon, and dinners are up to you aside from one all-team dinner on Thursday evening.

It’s important to acknowledge that meet-ups are tiring for a lot of us. We’re away from our family, friends, and home for a week. We’re interacting all day with coworkers when we’re used to working from home. We’re having fun and perhaps not getting much sleep. Remember that the meet-up is what you want it to be. If you want to skip dinner one night, skip dinner and take a bath in room. If you need some recharge time, and want to work from a coffee shop one afternoon, do it!

Most people leave on Friday during the work day. You should come to every meet-up, but if you have a pre-planned vacation or other engagement you can’t cancel, you won’t be admonished for missing one or two.
