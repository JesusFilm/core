# Setting Goals

Here at Jesus Film, we care about your growth. Often times people would work hard but feel like it’s going nowhere. A key reason for this is because they haven’t spent enough time thinking about what they want to achieve. Setting goals are here to help you grow.

## Jesus Film’s Goal

#### To Reach and Connect The Last, The Least & The Lost with partners and the body of Christ

## Objectives & Key Results (OKR)

To help set goals, we would be using a popular management framework called OKR. The main ideology behind OKR is to set goals that matter, goals with transparency, and better strategic alignment.

#### What is OKR?

OKR consists of three concepts: Objective, Key Results, and Initiatives. **Objectives** are a description of what you’d like to achieve. **Key Results** are the results you want to achieve to get to your Objectives. Lastly, **Initiatives** are the tasks required to help you achieve your Key Results.

Perdoo has produced an in-depth explanation of what is an OKR and [how to write OKR](https://www.perdoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/eBook-The-ultimate-guide-to-okr.pdf).

## Alignment

As mentioned above, setting OKR helps with better strategic alignment. This means aligning your OKR with our strategic pillars, personal goals, and engineering goals.

### Strategic Pillars

Pillars help a building stand strong when set right. These are our strategic pillars:

<ul>
  <li>Pursue operational excellence that gives our users confidence in our platforms</li>
  <li>Put loving people at the heart of our product development</li>
  <li>Be a team that our partners love to work with</li>
  <li>Build a culture where each team member learns and thrives</li>
</ul>

### Personal Development

Coming up with your own goals can take time and can be broad. The [Titles for Engineers](https://docs.core.jesusfilm.org/docs/team/making-a-career/titles-for-engineers) page defines what makes up each role. Your OKR needs to be aligned to the points mentioned on the next level you are aiming for.

For Example, if you are a **Junior Engineer** aiming to be an **Engineer**, one of the points mentioned on Engineer is **Follows established patterns and approaches within existing code bases with ease**. The OKR you write needs to relate to that.
