# General

Jesus Film uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as our primary library to build out front-end user interfaces. These are built on top of the [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-client) to manage state and back-end interactions. We leverage the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Framework to ship web based apps quickly and regularly on the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) platform.

We are building out our component libraries to support the growing needs of our product suite. To support this effort all of our components have stories attached for use in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). These stories are published to our library which can be found on our [Chromatic Library](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=612c2a83fdc2b2003a5c2eb7&groupPrefix=Journeys%2FBlocks).
