# Starting Projects

As an example we are going to run through the steps to get the Next Steps Journey project running in your web browser.

1. Start the gateway and microservices

```shell
nx run api-gateway:serve-all
```

2. Start a webserver e.g journeys

```shell
nx run journeys:serve
```

3. In your local browser navigate to [http://localhost:4100](http://localhost:4100)
