Microservices typically make use of a variety of database stores. The following command will create the required databases, migrate them to the latest state, and fill them with relevant data.

```shell
nx run-many --all --target=prisma-generate --parallel=1
```

```shell
nx run-many --all --target=prisma-migrate
```

```shell
nx run-many --all --target=prisma-seed
```

To ingest data from bigquery, you will need to start the ingest job. In one terminal, run:

```shell
nf start
```

In a separate terminal, run:

```shell
nx ingest api-languages
```

Once that has completed, run:

```shell
nx queue-ingest api-media
```

## Common Issues

### prisma-generate failing

If prisma-generate is failing, try running:

```shell
nx run-many -t prisma-reset --all
```

#### command failed because of mmdc

If prisma generate fails with a error message similar to the one below:

```shell
Command failed: "/workspaces/core/node_modules/-bin/mmdc" -i "/tmp/prisma-erd-q0 cpUx/prisma.mmd" -0 "/workspaces/core/apps/api-journeys/db/ERD.svg" -c"/tmp/pri
sma-erd-qOcpUx/config-json" -p"/tmp/prisma-erd-qOcpUx/puppeteerConfig-json"
```

It is related to [prisma-erd-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-erd-generator) attempting to run. Under the hood, it uses puppeteer and chromium to execute. The error this command is experiencing could be related to chromium not being installed, installed incorrectly, or not having the proper permissions to execute.

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve the issue:

- run `sudo apt-get -y install chromium`
- On Mac update Docker Desktop to at least 4.28.0
- rebuild your container using latest main
