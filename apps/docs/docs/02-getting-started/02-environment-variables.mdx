We use [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) as our team's central source of truth for secrets and app configuration.

1. Get invited to Jesus Film Doppler account by sending an email to our [Doppler Administrator](mailto:tataihono.nikora@jesusfilm.org?subject=Doppler%20Invite%20Request).
2. In a container terminal, login to the Doppler CLI

```shell
doppler login
```

2. Type `n<enter>` when asked to open authorization page in a browser

```shell
Open the authorization page in your browser? (Y/n) n
```

3. Open the [authorization page](https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/auth/cli) to complete authorization.
   This will require you to login to Doppler, copy your auth code from your terminal, and give your newly minted
   token a name. On completion you terminal should look like the following:

```shell
? Open the authorization page in your browser? No
Complete authorization at https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/auth/cli
Your auth code is:
north_zoom_ant_harmonica_eagle

Waiting...

Welcome, Brian
```

4. Fetch environment variables using `fetch-secrets`

```shell
DOPPLER_CONFIG=dev nx run-many --all --target=fetch-secrets
```

## Getting Started without a Backend

If you just want to dig right in without setting up a local backend then you run the following command:

```shell
DOPPLER_CONFIG=stg_dev nx run-many --projects=tag:doppler_config:stg_dev --target=fetch-secrets
```

This will point your local frontend projects to our stage api-gateway so you can get started right away.
For example you can start the journeys application using the following command:

```shell
nx run journeys-admin:serve
```

The key difference is the environment variable `DOPPLER_CONFIG=stg_dev` tells doppler to get enviroment variables
for the stg_dev environment of the relevant project instead. You can revert this change by following step 4 of
this guide again.

You can skip ahead to step 2 in [4. Starting Projects](/docs/getting-started/running-projects/projects-on-local-machine) guide if getting started without a backend.

### Common Issues

#### I changed to stg_dev environment variables but now I want to go back

You might already be working with your local backend but want to try some changes against stage.
Just run the following command (given above):

```shell
DOPPLER_CONFIG=dev nx run-many --all --target=fetch-secrets
```

#### COOKIE_SECRET_CURRENT mismatch

If you are signed in your web browser to localhost before performing DOPPLER_CONFIG change then you will need to
clear the cookies from your localhost as they will not match the stage cookie values and firebase credentials.

You'll see the error below this issue is relevant to you:

```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "key" argument must be of type string or an instance of ArrayBuffer, Buffer, TypedArray, DataView, KeyObject, or CryptoKey. Received undefined
