We use [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) as our team's central source of truth for secrets and app configuration.

1. Get invited to Jesus Film Doppler account by sending an email to our [Doppler Administrator](mailto:tataihono.nikora@jesusfilm.org?subject=Doppler%20Invite%20Request).
2. In a container terminal, login to the Doppler CLI

```shell
doppler login
```

2. Type `n<enter>` when asked to open authorization page in a browser

```shell
Open the authorization page in your browser? (Y/n) n
```

3. Open the [authorization page](https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/auth/cli) to complete authorization. This will require you to login to Doppler, copy your auth code from your terminal, and give your newly minted token a name. On completion you terminal should look like the following:

```shell
? Open the authorization page in your browser? No
Complete authorization at https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/auth/cli
Your auth code is:
