There are cries as the others are nailed to their crosses.\n\nThe nails are hammered through Jesus's wrists and feet as He screams. Then slowly, the crosses are erected as Romans pulls the ropes. Jesus is lifted high in the air. He hangs on the cross, tired and in pain. He prays for those in the crowd. He asks God to forgive them because they don't know what they do.\n\nThe crowd murmurs at the feet of the cross. Annas and Caiaphas comment that He saved others. They wonder why He doesn't save Himself. The crowd starts to jeer. They urge Him to save Himself. But He doesn't."
