      question: "How can I trust in God's sovereignty when the world feels so chaotic?",

          <p>
            Even in times of chaos and uncertainty, we can trust in
            God's sovereignty because:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              God remains in control even when circumstances feel out
              of control
            </li>
            <li>His purposes are higher than our understanding</li>
            <li>
              He promises to work all things for good for those who
              love Him
            </li>
            <li>
              The Bible shows countless examples of God bringing order
              from chaos

      question: "Why is Easter the most important Christian holiday?",
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>Easter is central to Christian faith because:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              It marks Jesus' resurrection, proving His victory over
              death
            </li>
            <li>
              It fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah
            </li>
            <li>It demonstrates God's power to give new life</li>
            <li>
              It provides hope for our own resurrection and eternal
              life
            </li>

      answer: (
        <>
          <p>The Bible tells us several key events occurred:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Jesus' body was placed in a tomb and guarded by Roman
              soldiers
            </li>
            <li>His followers mourned and waited in uncertainty</li>
            <li>
              According to Scripture, He descended to the realm of the
              dead
            </li>
            <li>On the third day, He rose victorious over death</li>
