Being good by human standards isn\'t enough to remove the guilt of sin. Salvation is not earned by good deeds but received by grace through faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:8â€“9). Only His sacrifice can cleanse us and make us right with God.'

Jesus died in our place as a perfect sacrifice to satisfy God\'s justice and show His love. Hebrews 9:22 says, "Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." Jesus paid the debt we couldn\'t pay, and through Him, forgiveness is offered.'

Some are blinded by pride, sin, or the world's distractions (2 Corinthians 4:4). Others have not truly heard the Gospel or have hardened their hearts. Faith is a response to God's call, but He does not force anyone to believe (Revelation 3:20)."
