Why would they punish an innocent man? The roar of the crowd seals their fate—crucifixion. Forced to carry their crosses to Golgotha, he stumbles beside Jesus, the weight of his past and his sentence crushing him. As nails pierce flesh and the sky darkens, he makes a desperate plea—could this truly be the Messiah? In his final moments, Jesus gives him an unexpected promise: Today, you will be with me in paradise. Watch as this powerful moment unfolds."

                        <p>
                          Jesus' death was necessary to fulfill God's plan of
                          redemption. Because of sin, humanity was separated from
                          God, but Jesus' sacrifice provided the way for
                          reconciliation. Here's why His death was essential:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">

                          <li>Jesus, as the perfect sacrifice, took our place</li>
                          <li>
                            Through His death, we receive forgiveness and
                            restoration

                          God's love and justice go hand in hand. While He desires
                          to forgive, He also upholds justice. Jesus' sacrifice
                          was the ultimate expression of both:

                            Forgiveness requires a cost, and Jesus paid that cost
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            His death satisfied God's justice while showing His
                            mercy

                          <li>
                            His sacrifice allows us to be restored without

                          The Bible teaches that everything began with God, the
                          Creator of the universe. He spoke everything into
                          existence with purpose and design. Humanity was created
                          in His image to live in harmony with Him, each other,
                          and creation.

                            Everything was originally perfect, without pain or

                          Suffering exists because sin entered the world when
                          humanity chose to rebel against God. This disobedience
                          broke the original perfection, introducing death, pain,
                          and separation from God.

                          Yes! God sent Jesus as the rescuer. Jesus lived a
                          perfect life, died on the cross to pay for sin, and rose
                          from the dead to defeat death itself. Through Him, we
                          can be restored to God and experience a new life.
