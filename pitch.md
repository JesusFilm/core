[NS] AI Translation
Author: Ziwei Liu
Date drafted: 24/04/25
Problem
Churches around the world often have members who speak different heart languages, making it difficult to communicate important information and invitations inclusively.
Currently, translating user-generated content is manual and inconsistent, which can exclude non-English speakers and limit engagement.
Howard also wants journeys translated so they can be used on non-English JESUS film clips, but the lack of an integrated translation solution makes this challenging.
Appetite
4 weeks.
This timeframe includes design, implementation, testing, and deployment of the translation feature as described.
Assumes availability of required AI translation models and no major changes to existing journey duplication logic.
Solution
We will implement an AI-powered translation feature that enables users to automatically translate user-generated content in journeys to different languages. This solution will provide a seamless way for churches to reach their multilingual congregations, increase engagement through heart-language communication, and enable the reuse of journeys across different language communities—all while preserving the original meaning and context of the content.

Create a journey in a different language from an existing journey in my team
User clicks TRANSLATE from menu
Show a translate modal
This creates a new copy of the journey but translates the written text

Create a journey in a different language from an existing journey to another team
User clicks COPY TO from journey list menu
Show the team / language modal
This creates a new copy of the journey but translates the written text

Create a journey in a different language from a template
User clicks USE THIS TEMPLATE
Show the team / language modal
[Stretch] For not signed in user, add language ID so correct language can be set later on
This creates a new copy of the journey but translates the written text

Translate modal
Dev can select the AI model to use for translation (At the API Level, no interface currently required).
Only languages supported by the selected AI model + i18n languages are shown.
Translates user generated text (not videos, links, host details)
Includes Journey name and description, social media related text
Includes default text labels generated by us eg "Submit"
Excludes system/platform messages and error messages (these are handled by the platform)
Applying the translation will duplicate the journey and apply the translation, using existing duplication logic.
Translation is auto-applied and handled as a background job; user receives async notification when complete.
After translation, users can edit the translated journey as needed.
Anyone with access to the journey in NextSteps admin can use this feature.

Team / Language modal
Titled “Add Journey to team” or something similar, must be used on both above use cases
Language list comes from amalgamation of i18n languages + AI languages

Notifications
Indicate to the user translation has started / in progress
Indicate the the user when the journey is done, allow them to click and navigate to it
Can we dismiss toast?
Can we see the failed state of translation?
Can we restart translation if it fails?
Can we cancel the translation mid job?
Stretch
Create a journey in a different language from scratch
Journey Details modal pops up, when user clicks “Save”, THEN create the new journey
The default language in the modal should match the admin profile language
Right now, journey language list taken from arclight video languages
Profile languages taken from crowdin
So there needs to be a mapping
The written text in default card should match the language set

Arclight Video Translation
The language list should be
Either the common languages between crowdin / AI / arclight
OR have separate video language field that shows all arclight languages

Create a journey in a different language from the current journey in Editor
If we discover translation is really fast then allow translating of the current journey
Might need to pause the whole page but discover later.
Rabbit Holes / Unknowns
Handling of async notification and background job status updates.
No-goes / Out of Bounds
System/platform messages and error messages are not translated by this feature.
No feedback or analytics mechanism for translations.
Key Behaviors to Test
Only supported languages for the selected model are shown.
Translation is auto-applied and the journey is duplicated correctly using existing logic.
Async notification is sent to the user when translation is complete.
Permissions: feature is only visible to users with journey access in admin.
Model selection works and the correct model is used for translation.
Users can edit the translated journey after translation is complete.
The language of the journey changes thus the RTL also is updated.
