# PR Description Writing

## The core principle

The diff is already visible on GitHub. The description exists to explain what the diff cannot show: what was impossible before and is now possible, what was broken and is now fixed, what shape changed. Cut any sentence a reader could reconstruct from the diff itself.

- Bad: "Adds `evidence-decider.ts`, modifies `ce-commit-push-pr/SKILL.md` to call it, and updates two test files."
- Good: "Evidence capture now decides automatically whether a change has observable behavior. CLI tools and libraries are now eligible alongside web UIs."

If the lead sentence describes what was moved, renamed, or added rather than what's now possible or fixed, rewrite it. This applies to every section, not just the opening — restating the diff is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

## Step Pre-A: Resolve the range and base

Two modes:

- **Current-branch mode** (default) — describe HEAD vs the repo's default base.
- **PR mode** — describe a specific PR. Triggered when the caller passes a PR ref.

For PR mode, fetch metadata first:

```bash
gh pr view <ref> --json baseRefName,headRefOid,url,body,state,isCrossRepository,headRepositoryOwner
```

If `state` is not `OPEN`, report and stop — do not invent a description. Use `baseRefName` as `<base>` and `headRefOid` as `<head>`.

For current-branch mode, resolve `<base>` in priority order: caller-supplied (`base:<ref>`) → `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD` (strip `origin/`) → `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'` → try `main`/`master`/`develop` via `git rev-parse --verify origin/<candidate>`. If none resolve, ask the user. `<head>` is `HEAD`.

**Base remote:** `origin` for current-branch mode and same-repo PRs. For fork PRs, match the PR's base owner/repo against `git remote -v`. If no local remote matches, skip to the `gh` fallback — do not diff against `origin` (wrong base).

```bash
git fetch --no-tags <base-remote> <base>
git fetch --no-tags <base-remote> <head>   # PR mode only: <head> is headRefOid and may not be local
git log  --oneline "<base-remote>/<base>..<head>"
git diff           "<base-remote>/<base>...<head>"
```

If the commit list is empty, report "No commits to describe" and stop.

**Fallback** — use `gh pr diff <ref>` and `gh pr view <ref> --json commits` when local git can't reach the refs (fork PR with no matching remote, shallow clone, offline, merge-base on unrelated histories). For GHES configurations that reject SHA fetch but allow `refs/pull/`:

```bash
git fetch --no-tags <base-remote> "refs/pull/<number>/head"
PR_HEAD_SHA=$(awk '/refs\/pull\/[0-9]+\/head/ {print $1; exit}' "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/FETCH_HEAD")
```

Note in the user-facing summary when the API fallback was used.

## Step A: Size the description

Match weight to weight. When in doubt, shorter wins. Subtract fix-up commits (review fixes, lint, rebase resolutions) when sizing — they're invisible to the reader. Large PRs need more selectivity, not more content.

| Change profile | Description approach |
|---|---|
| Small + simple (typo, config, dep bump) | 1-2 sentences, no headers. Under ~300 characters. |
| Small + non-trivial (bugfix, behavioral change) | 3-5 sentences. No headers unless two distinct concerns. |
| Medium feature or refactor | Narrative frame, then what changed and why. Call out design decisions. |
| Large or architecturally significant | Narrative frame + 3-5 design-decision callouts + brief test summary. Target ~100 lines, cap ~150. For PRs with many mechanisms, use a Summary table; do not create an H3 per mechanism. |
| Performance improvement | Include before/after measurements as a markdown table. |

For small + simple PRs, the value-led sentence is the entire description.

---

## Step B: Compose the title

`type: description` or `type(scope): description`.

- Type by intent, not file extension. When `fix` and `feat` both seem to fit, default to `fix` — adding code to remedy missing behavior is `fix`. Reserve `feat` for capabilities the user could not previously accomplish. Use `refactor`/`docs`/`chore`/`perf`/`test` when more precise.
- Scope (optional): narrowest useful label. Omit when no single label adds clarity.
- Description: imperative, lowercase, under 72 chars, no trailing period.
- Match repo conventions visible in recent commits.
- **Never use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` without explicit user confirmation** — they trigger automated major-version bumps.

## Step C: Assemble the body

In order: opening → body sections that earn their keep → test plan if non-obvious → evidence block if one exists → Compound Engineering badge after a `---` rule.

The opening goes under `## Summary` if the body uses any `##` headings; bare paragraph otherwise. No orphaned opening paragraphs above the first heading.

**Evidence handling:** preserve any existing `## Demo` or `## Screenshots` block verbatim unless the user's focus asks to refresh it. If the caller passed a freshly captured URL or path, splice as `## Demo`. Otherwise omit. Place before the badge. Never label test output as "Demo" or "Screenshots."

**Visual aids:** reach for a diagram or table when it conveys the change faster than prose — relationships, flows, state transitions, sequences, trade-offs, before/after data, or any structure prose would have to enumerate. Mermaid and markdown tables cover most shapes; don't be limited to a particular type if a different one fits the change better. Place inline at the point of relevance. Skip for simple, prose-clear, or rename/dep-bump changes. Prose is authoritative when it conflicts with a visual.

**GitHub gotchas:** never prefix list items with `#` (GitHub auto-links `#1` as an issue ref). Use `org/repo#123` or full URL for actual references.

## Step D: Badge

```markdown
---

[![Compound Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-Compound_Engineering-6366f1)](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)
![HARNESS](https://img.shields.io/badge/MODEL_SLUG-COLOR?logo=LOGO&logoColor=white)
```

| Harness | `LOGO` | `COLOR` |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `D97757` |
| Codex | (omit `?logo=` param) | `000000` |
| Gemini CLI | `googlegemini` | `4285F4` |

**Model slug:** spaces become underscores; append context window and thinking level in parens if known. **URL-encode literal parens as `%28` / `%29`** — unencoded parens inside markdown image URLs break release-please's commit parser, which silently drops the commit from the changelog. Examples: `Opus_4.6_%281M,_Extended_Thinking%29`, `Sonnet_4.6_%28200K%29`, `Gemini_3.1_Pro`.

Skip the badge if regenerating a body that already contains it.
