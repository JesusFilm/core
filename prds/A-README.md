# PRDs Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for various features and projects implemented in the codebase. These documents serve as a historical record and reference point for understanding the requirements, decisions, and implementation details of each feature.

## What is a PRD?

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a comprehensive document that outlines the purpose, features, functionality, and behavior of a product or feature. As described in [The Importance of PRD Documents in Cursor Projects](https://www.cursor.new/blog/importance-of-prd-in-cursor-projects), a PRD serves as a "single source of truth that aligns all stakeholders on what needs to be built."

## Why We Maintain PRDs

1. **Historical Context**: PRDs provide valuable context about why certain features were built and how they were intended to function.
2. **AI Assistance**: These documents help AI systems (like Claude) better understand the reasoning behind implementation decisions, making it easier to provide relevant assistance when modifying or extending features.
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: As team members change over time, PRDs preserve the knowledge and context that might otherwise be lost.
4. **Clear Project Vision**: Each PRD establishes clear objectives and success criteria for a feature, helping to prevent scope creep and ensure alignment with business goals.

## What Goes Into This Directory

Each PRD in this directory typically follows a consistent format and includes:

1. **Overview**: A high-level description of the feature or project
2. **Problem Statement**: The specific problem being solved
3. **Requirements**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Design Specifications**: UI/UX guidelines, wireframes, or mockups
5. **Technical Considerations**: Architecture decisions, API specifications, etc.
6. **Implementation Guidelines**: Specific guidance for developers
7. **Timeline**: Expected phases and milestones
8. **Success Metrics**: How the success of the feature will be measured

## Naming Convention

PRDs are named according to their corresponding ticket or issue number (e.g., `ENG-1939.md` for the Watch site footer redesign). This makes it easy to cross-reference PRDs with tickets in our project management system.

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant helping with code in this repository:

1. **Reference These Documents**: When working on a feature, check if there's a corresponding PRD to understand the original requirements and design decisions.
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure that any changes or additions you suggest align with the principles and patterns established in the relevant PRD.
3. **Suggest Updates**: If you notice that a PRD is outdated or inconsistent with the current implementation, suggest updates to keep the documentation accurate.

## Best Practices

As noted in the [Cursor Projects article](https://www.cursor.new/blog/importance-of-prd-in-cursor-projects), effective PRDs should be:

- **Clear**: Written in unambiguous language
- **Complete**: Covering all aspects of the feature
- **Consistent**: Maintaining uniform terminology
- **Testable**: Including requirements that can be verified
- **Living**: Updated as the project evolves

By maintaining high-quality PRDs, we create a more maintainable codebase and facilitate better collaboration between team members and AI assistants.
