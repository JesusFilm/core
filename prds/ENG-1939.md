# ENG-1939: Watch Site Footer Redesign

## Overview

The Watch site footer needed to be redesigned to match the jesusfilm.org footer design. This update creates a cohesive brand experience between the two properties, ensuring visual and functional consistency across Jesus Film's digital platforms.

## Problem Statement

The previous Watch site footer design and structure differed from the jesusfilm.org footer. This inconsistency created a disconnected user experience between the two properties, potentially confusing users and diluting brand recognition. The redesign aligns the Watch site footer with the jesusfilm.org footer to create a unified brand experience.

## Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements

   - Maintain proper contrast ratios for text readability
   - Include appropriate alt text for images

3. **Internationalization**
   - Support text translation through the existing i18n framework
   - Ensure layout accommodates text expansion in different languages

## Design Specifications

### Layout

The footer is structured in two main sections:

1. **Upper section**: Logo, social media icons, navigation links, and "Give Now" button
2. **Lower section**: Address, contact information, legal links, and newsletter section

### Colors and Typography

- Background color: Matches the jesusfilm.org footer (background.default)
- Text colors: Primary text color for most elements
- Typography: Uses the application's typography system with appropriate sizing
- Link hover states: Subtle visual feedback on interaction

### Component Structure

- **Main Footer Component**: Container for all footer elements
- **FooterLink Component**: Reusable component for all links, supporting both text and image links
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses Material UI's Stack component for flexible layouts

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Details

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material UI for consistent styling and layout
- **Image Handling**: Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- **Internationalization**: next-i18next for text translation
- **Responsive Design**: Material UI's responsive system with breakpoints

### Code Structure

```tsx
// Main components
- Footer.tsx: Main container component
- FooterLink/FooterLink.tsx: Reusable link component

// Testing
- Footer.spec.tsx: Unit tests for the Footer component
- FooterLink/FooterLink.spec.tsx: Unit tests for the FooterLink component

// Storybook
- Footer.stories.tsx: Storybook stories for the Footer component
```

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Reusable FooterLink Component**: Created a versatile component that handles both text and image links with consistent styling
2. **Responsive Layout Strategy**: Used Stack components with responsive properties to handle different screen sizes
3. **Internationalization**: Implemented t() function for all text strings to support multiple languages
4. **Social Media Icons**: Used SVG icons for better scaling and performance

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Usage

The Footer component is used at the bottom of all pages in the Watch site. It requires no props and handles all functionality internally:

```tsx
<Footer />
```

The FooterLink component is used for all links within the Footer and accepts the following props:

```tsx
<FooterLink
  url="/about/" // URL for the link
  label="About Us" // Text or alt text for images
  variant="h6" // Typography variant (optional)
  underline="none" // Link underline style (optional)
  src="/path/to/img.svg" // Image source (optional)
  width={24} // Image width (optional)
  height={24} // Image height (optional)
  target="_blank" // Link target (optional)
  noFollow={true} // Whether to add nofollow attribute (optional)
/>
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify all links are correct and functional
2. **Responsive Testing**: Ensure proper display across various device sizes
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Validate that all elements meet accessibility standards

## Success Metrics

The footer redesign is considered successful when:

1. Visual appearance matches the jesusfilm.org footer
2. All links are functional and direct to the proper destinations
3. Responsive behavior works correctly on both mobile and desktop
4. All test cases pass
5. No regression in existing functionality

## Implementation Status

The footer redesign has been successfully implemented in the Watch site. The component now matches the jesusfilm.org footer in both appearance and functionality, creating a cohesive brand experience across both platforms.
