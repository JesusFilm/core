# Slices Plan (vertical, value-first)

# Instructions for Filling Slices Template

This template follows ShapeUp principles of vertical, value-first feature delivery. Each slice should:

1. Deliver end-to-end user value
2. Address risks early
3. Start simple and iterate
4. Be testable and production-ready

## CRITICAL: ShapeUp Slicing Approach

**IMPORTANT**: Each slice represents a STAGE of the SAME FEATURE, not different features. The approach is:

1. **Basic Implementation**: Minimal working version of the complete feature
2. **Improved Implementation**: Enhanced version of the same feature with additional capabilities
3. **Polished Implementation**: Final optimized version of the same feature

**DO NOT** create separate features for each slice. Instead, create stages of the same feature with increasing sophistication.

### Example Structure:
- **Slice 1 Basic**: Minimal homepage with static content
- **Slice 1 Improved**: Same homepage with animations and interactions
- **Slice 1 Polished**: Same homepage with performance optimization and advanced features

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Creating separate features (e.g., "Header", "Hero", "Video Grid" as different slices)
- ❌ Building different components in each slice
- ✅ Building the SAME feature with increasing complexity

See `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/_template/slices-instructions.md` for detailed instructions on:
- Breaking down features into vertical slices
- Defining must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Setting clear Definition of Done criteria
- Tracking slice status and progress
- Mapping requirements to implementation
