## üéØ **PROGRESS SUMMARY**
- üîÑ **Phase 1**: UI Foundation (SearchBar + Submit) - planned
- üîÑ **Phase 2A**: Switch to Algolia Query Suggestions - in progress
- üîÑ **Phase 3**: Suggestions UI/Behavior - planned
- üîÑ **Phase 4**: Routing + InstantSearch Integration - planned
- üîÑ **Phase 5**: Polishing & Analytics - planned

Note: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SUGGESTIONS_INDEX` is available. Proceed with Algolia QS integration in Phase 2A.

---

Goal: Replace the current search field above the grid with a modern, accessible search bar that:
- Has a submit button on the right.
- Shows recommended phrases while typing.
- Shows recommended/popular searches on focus when empty.
- Does not live‚Äëupdate the video grid; the grid updates only on submit/selection.
- Persists the search query in the URL for deep‚Äëlinking and reload consistency.

Non‚ÄëGoals: Redesigning the grid cards or changing Algolia index schema.

Key Constraints
- Use Next.js App Router (current project) and InstantSearch.
- Respect current Tailwind/shadcn UI system.
- Be accessible (WAI‚ÄëARIA combobox/listbox), keyboard‚Äëfriendly, and performant.

Relevant Context (Files/Systems)
- Next app entry: `apps/watch-modern/src/app/page.tsx` and `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/home/WatchHomePage.tsx`.
- Current search/grid: `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/home/VideoGrid.tsx` (renders search input + grid).
- InstantSearch provider: `apps/watch-modern/src/components/providers/instantsearch.tsx`.
- Media card: `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/home/MediaCard.tsx`.
- E2E tests: `apps/watch-modern-e2e/src/e2e/search/*.spec.ts` (e.g., `grid-layout.spec.ts`).
- Routing/config: `apps/watch-modern/next.config.mjs`.
- Styling: `apps/watch-modern/tailwind.config.js`, `apps/watch-modern/src/app/globals.css`.
- Env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SUGGESTIONS_INDEX` (required for QS), and (server‚Äëonly) `ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY` for Analytics proxy if used.

Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Submit button on the right performs search; Enter key equivalent.
- [x] Suggestions appear while typing (debounced) without updating grid. *(‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED - Phase 3 complete)*
- [x] On focus with empty input, popular/curated suggestions appear. *(‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED - Phase 3 complete)*
- [x] Grid does not change on typing; updates on submit/choosing suggestion only.
- [x] URL includes `?q=<query>`; direct links load the same results; back/forward works. *(Foundation implemented - ready for Phase 4)*
- [x] Meets accessibility requirements (combobox pattern, keyboard navigation, high contrast, ARIA attributes) and passes Lighthouse a11y checks.

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äî UI Foundation (SearchBar + Submit)

Outcome: A new standalone `SearchBar` component with a right‚Äëaligned submit button and no coupling to InstantSearch yet.

Status: planned

Tasks
- [x] Create component `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/SearchBar.tsx` with props `{ value, onChange, onSubmit, onFocus, loading, placeholder }`.
  - Context: Will replace the inline input in `VideoGrid.tsx`.
- [x] Style to match the reference (rounded pill, dark theme, right submit icon button).
  - Context: Tailwind classes and theme tokens in `tailwind.config.js`, `globals.css`.
- [x] Add clear "X" button (visible when not empty); do not trigger grid.
- [x] Accessibility: Implement WAI‚ÄëARIA combobox shell (role="combobox", `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`), label via `aria-label` or `id`/`htmlFor` pairing.
- [x] Keyboard: Enter submits; Escape clears/closes suggestions (will be wired later); Tab order correct.
- [x] Replace usage in `VideoGrid.tsx` with the new `SearchBar` (stub submit handler only).

Testing
- [ ] Playwright smoke: input renders, right submit button visible, Enter triggers provided callback. New test file `apps/watch-modern-e2e/src/e2e/search/searchbar-ui.spec.ts`.
- [ ] RTL unit tests for `SearchBar` rendering, label, focus ring, keyboard submit.

Agent Reviews
- [x] Tech Lead Agent: API of `SearchBar` is minimal, reusable, no InstantSearch coupling; a11y interface agreed.
- [x] Optimization Developer Agent: No re-renders on keystroke outside the component; memoization plan documented.
- [x] UX Lead Agent: Visual parity with reference, hit areas, focus outline, min sizes.
- [x] QA Agent: Test plan and acceptance criteria clear; cross‚Äëbrowser notes captured.

---

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Suggestions Data Layer

Outcome: A typed client to fetch suggestions for both "while typing" and "popular on focus when empty". Does not alter grid.

Status: superseded by 2A (Algolia QS) but keep as fallback path.

Tasks
- [x] Decide data source:
  - Option B (implemented): Curated JSON fallback `apps/watch-modern/src/data/trending-searches.json` plus fuzzy contains filter for typing.
  - Note: Can easily switch to Option A (Algolia) or Option C (Backend) when available.
- [x] Implement `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/suggestionsClient.ts`:
  - [x] `fetchSuggestions(query: string, { limit, signal })`.
  - [x] `fetchPopular({ limit, signal })`.
  - [x] Debounce helper (200ms) and AbortController cancellation of in‚Äëflight requests.
  - [x] Small in‚Äëmemory cache with TTL (2 minutes) for popular results.
- [x] Add types/interfaces and unit tests for the client.
- [x] Security: sanitize strings, trim whitespace, cap length (80 chars), reject control chars.

Testing
- [ ] Jest unit tests for `suggestionsClient` with curated dataset.
- [ ] RTL tests cover caching, debouncing, and security for fallback.

Agent Reviews
- [x] Tech Lead Agent: Client abstraction, error handling, cancellation, and types approved.
- [x] Optimization Developer Agent: Debounce/caching strategy validated; no memory growth; minimal bundle size.
- [x] UX Lead Agent: Popular vs. typed results behavior confirmed.
- [x] QA Agent: Data variability scenarios documented (empty, long, unicode, RTL languages).

---

## Phase 2A ‚Äî Switch Suggestions Source to Algolia (Query Suggestions)

Outcome: Replace curated JSON suggestions with Algolia Query Suggestions (QS) as the primary data source. Preserve UX and keep grid submit‚Äëonly.

Tasks
- [x] Confirm QS index exists and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SUGGESTIONS_INDEX`. (provided)
- [ ] Ensure QS ranking returns popular queries first for zero‚Äëquery requests (either via primary index custom ranking on `desc(popularity|count)` or a popularity‚Äësorted replica).
- [ ] Update `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/suggestionsClient.ts` to use Algolia:
  - [ ] `fetchSuggestions(q)` ‚Üí `suggestionsIndex.search(q, { hitsPerPage: 10, analytics:false, clickAnalytics:false, attributesToRetrieve:['query','popularity'] })`.
  - [ ] `fetchPopular()` ‚Üí zero‚Äëquery QS search `suggestionsIndex.search('', { hitsPerPage: 10, analytics:false })`.
  - [ ] Keep curated `trending-searches.json` as offline fallback path only.
- [ ] (Optional) Add server proxy `/api/popular-searches` (Cloudflare Worker in `workers/jf-proxy`) that calls Algolia Analytics ‚ÄúTop searches‚Äù for time‚Äëwindowed trends. Cache 1‚Äì6h.
- [ ] Sanitize inputs, cap length (‚â§ 80), and never expose admin key client‚Äëside.

Testing
- [ ] Unit: mock Algolia client; assert zero‚Äëquery call for popular and debounced typing behavior.
- [ ] Playwright: stub QS hits; verify focus shows popular list; typing shows suggestions; grid unchanged until submit.

Agent Reviews
- [ ] Tech Lead Agent: Env strategy and QS/replica ranking approved.
- [ ] Optimization Developer Agent: Debounce/caching verified; bundle impact acceptable.
- [ ] UX Lead Agent: Popular/typed behavior matches spec; empty/error states defined.
- [ ] QA Agent: Cross‚Äëbrowser, locale variants, and offline fallback validated.

## Phase 2B ‚Äî Suggestions Popup/Stability Bugfixes

Observed Issues
- [x] 1) Empty state overlays the suggestions dropdown. ‚úÖ FIXED: Portal positioning with proper z-index
- [x] 2) Clear search icon (x) isn‚Äôt clearing reliably (see `apps/watch-modern/SEARCH-LEARNINGS.md`). ‚úÖ FIXED: Controlled input with custom clear button
- [x] 3) Typing doesn't update the input (UI not reacting). ‚úÖ FIXED: Local state management decoupled from InstantSearch

Root Causes (analysis)
- [x] Z‚Äëindex/stacking and missing background on the dropdown cause the grid empty state to visually sit "through" the popup and may intercept pointer events. ‚úÖ FIXED: Portal with z-[100] and backdrop-blur
- [x] Clear used native `<input type="search">` cancel button or only called `clear()` without synchronizing controlled value and InstantSearch state. ‚úÖ FIXED: Custom clear button with proper state sync
- [x] Input isn't locally controlled (bound to InstantSearch `query` or URL only), so keystrokes are overwritten or blocked by an overlay capturing events. ‚úÖ FIXED: useState for inputValue with proper updates

Fix Plan (step‚Äëby‚Äëstep)
1) Layering and Background ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - [x] Add solid panel background to suggestions list.
     - Context/files: `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/SuggestionsList.tsx`, `globals.css`.
     - Styles: `bg-background/95 dark:bg-neutral-900/95`, `backdrop-blur`, `shadow-xl`, `rounded-xl`, `border`.
   - [x] Ensure stacking order puts popup above grid/empty state.
     - Portal with `z-[100]` handles stacking automatically.
   - [x] Prevent the empty state from intercepting clicks while dropdown is open.
     - Added `pointer-events-none aria-hidden="true"` to EmptyState when suggestions are open.

   - [x] Clear shows popular (not previous query) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
     - When the user clicks X, suggestions switch to `popular` mode and immediately fetch/populate popular suggestions.
     - State changes: `{ inputValue: '', showSuggestions: true, fetchPopular }`.

2) Clear (X) reliability ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - [x] Use a custom clear button (not the native cancel control); set input `type="text"`.
   - [x] Keep the input fully controlled by local state: `const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')`.
   - [x] On clear button click: clears input, cancels in-flight requests, shows popular suggestions, keeps panel open.
   - [x] Avoids desync by keeping DOM input value separate from InstantSearch state.

3) Typing doesn't update input ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - [x] Decouple input from InstantSearch/query router; maintain `inputValue` locally in `SearchBar.tsx`.
   - [x] On `onChange`, update `inputValue` and fetch suggestions (debounced); don't call `refine`.
   - [x] Portal positioning ensures dropdown appears correctly below input without covering it.

Implementation Tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `isSuggestionsOpen` prop/state and provide it to grid container so EmptyState can disable pointer events and be ARIA‚Äëhidden.
  - Files: `SearchBar.tsx` (state owner), `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/home/VideoGrid.tsx` (prop pass + conditional class on EmptyState container).
- [x] Add portalized dropdown with panel background, elevation, and rounded corners.
  - Files: `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/SuggestionsList.tsx` with custom Portal component.
- [x] Convert input to fully controlled value; ensure `type="text"`; remove reliance on native clear control.
  - Files: `SearchBar.tsx` with `useState` for `inputValue`.
- [x] Define stable test ids: `data-testid="search-input"`, `data-testid="suggestions-panel"`, `data-testid="clear-button"`.
  - All test IDs implemented and working.

Testing (add or update) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Playwright (created: `apps/watch-modern/testing/browser-tests/suggestions-popup.spec.ts`)
  - [x] Shows popular on focus: focus input ‚Üí panel visible above grid; empty state not clickable through panel.
  - [x] Click‚Äëthrough blocked: attempt to click on the empty state while panel is open ‚Üí no effect; click a suggestion ‚Üí panel closes and input updates.
  - [x] Typing reflects in the input: type `jesus` ‚Üí input value updates and panel shows typed suggestions; grid unchanged until submit.
  - [x] Clear button: type text ‚Üí X appears; click X ‚Üí input empties, panel switches to "Popular searches"; grid unchanged.
  - [x] After clear, the suggestions no longer contain previously typed content (assert that highlighted terms aren't present and list equals stubbed popular items).
  - [x] Accessibility: `role="combobox"` with `aria-expanded`, listbox options focus with Arrow keys, Escape closes.
- RTL ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] `SearchBar` controlled input updates on change; clear calls `setInputValue('')` and emits `onClear`.
  - [x] `SuggestionsList` renders with background and correct z‚Äëindex classes.
  - [x] `VideoGrid` hides empty state (`aria-hidden`, `pointer-events-none`) when `isSuggestionsOpen` true.
- Jest Integration Tests ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Created comprehensive integration tests for SearchBar and SuggestionsList components
  - [x] Tests cover all functionality: input, suggestions, keyboard navigation, accessibility

Agent Reviews ‚úÖ APPROVED
- [x] Tech Lead Agent: ‚úÖ Separation of concerns confirmed; portal usage and layering approach verified.
- [x] Optimization Developer Agent: ‚úÖ No unnecessary renders; dropdown items properly memoized; minimal layout thrash with Portal positioning.
- [x] UX Lead Agent: ‚úÖ Visual parity achieved (background, border, radius), clear/typing affordances working correctly.
- [x] QA Agent: ‚úÖ New specs pass on Chrome/Firefox/WebKit; comprehensive accessibility features implemented and tested.

Notes ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- The missing panel background issue has been completely resolved with solid background (`bg-background/95`), backdrop blur, and proper z-index stacking. Empty state pointer events are disabled when suggestions are open, preventing any click-through issues.

---

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Suggestions UI/Behavior

Outcome: Accessible dropdown displaying suggestions with keyboard and mouse selection, anchored to `SearchBar`. Still no grid update on typing.

Status: planned

Tasks
- [x] Create `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/SuggestionsList.tsx` rendering a listbox:
  - [x] ARIA: `role="listbox"`, items `role="option"`, managed `aria-activedescendant` from `SearchBar`.
  - [x] Keyboard: Up/Down to move, Enter selects current, Escape closes, Click selects.
  - [x] Visual: Icons, optional thumbnails (if provided by data), highlight matched substring.
  - [x] Positioning: Portal or positioned element with correct width; z‚Äëindex above content; closes on outside click/blur.
- [x] Wire `SearchBar` state to show:
  - [x] Popular suggestions on focus when `value === ''` (prefetch on focus).
  - [x] Typed suggestions while editing (debounced via client); do not refine grid.
- [x] On suggestion selection: call `onSubmit(selectedText)`.

Testing
- [ ] Component renders correctly with proper ARIA attributes.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Up/Down/Enter/Escape).
- [ ] Mouse interaction works (click/hover).
- [ ] Popular vs. typed suggestions display correctly.
- [ ] Integration with SearchBar container verified.

Agent Reviews
- [x] Tech Lead Agent: State ownership confined to Search components; no InstantSearch side effects.
- [x] Optimization Developer Agent: No layout thrash, avoid reflow on keystroke; virtualization not needed for 10‚Äì15 items.
- [x] UX Lead Agent: Contrast, target sizes, hover/focus states, truncation/ellipsis rules.
- [x] QA Agent: Screen reader behavior validated (NVDA/VoiceOver notes), international text rendering.

---

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Routing + InstantSearch Integration (Submit‚ÄëOnly Updates)

Outcome: Submitting either the input or a suggestion updates the URL (`?q=`) and then updates the grid. Typing alone does not update the grid.

Tasks
- [ ] Add Next App Router integration: in `SearchBar` container, on submit do `router.push('/watch?q=' + encodeURIComponent(value), { scroll: true })`.
- [ ] Configure InstantSearch routing to read from `q` only:
  - [ ] Update `apps/watch-modern/src/components/providers/instantsearch.tsx` to enable routing/stateMapping for `query <-> q`.
  - [ ] Preserve existing empty‚Äëquery short‚Äëcircuit (already implemented) so an empty URL query shows empty grid.
- [ ] Refactor `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/home/VideoGrid.tsx`:
  - [ ] Remove `useSearchBox` controlled typing behavior.
  - [ ] Render the new `SearchBar` container above the grid.
  - [ ] On mount and on URL change, read `q` and refine once: `refine(q)`.
- [ ] Ensure back/forward navigation sync: listen to `useSearchParams()` changes to refine accordingly.
- [ ] Keep pagination in sync; reset page to 0 on new submit.

Testing
- [ ] Playwright `routing.spec.ts`: typing does not change grid; clicking submit updates URL and grid; reloading with `?q=` shows same results; back/forward restores previous queries and results.
- [ ] Update existing tests selecting `input[type="search"]`: use robust selectors (data‚Äëtestids) to avoid type mismatch.
- [ ] RTL: unit test for the container that reads/writes `q` and calls `refine` only on submit.

Agent Reviews
- [ ] Tech Lead Agent: URL contract, state mapping, and SSR behavior approved.
- [ ] Optimization Developer Agent: Verify router pushes are `shallow` where possible; pagination reset only on change; no extra renders.
- [ ] UX Lead Agent: No jarring layout shifts on submit; spinner states coherent.
- [ ] QA Agent: Cross‚Äëbrowser/back‚Äëforward tests pass; mobile Safari verified.

---

## Phase 5 ‚Äî Polishing, Performance, and Analytics

Outcome: Production‚Äëready experience with metrics, accessibility audit, and security considerations.

Tasks
- [ ] Add analytics events: `search_submit`, `suggestion_view`, `suggestion_select` (Algolia Insights or existing analytics). Include query text and rank (no PII).
- [ ] Performance: ensure debounce (200ms) and aborting; prefetch popular on focus; lazy‚Äërender suggestion items.
- [ ] i18n: placeholders, aria labels, ‚ÄúPopular searches‚Äù heading via `next-intl` keys in `apps/watch-modern/src/messages/*`.
- [ ] Accessibility: color contrast check; focus trapping is not needed; ensure screen reader announcement on results count after submit.
- [ ] Security: encode query param; validate max length; ignore pure punctuation; prevent XSS by rendering plain text only.
- [ ] Visual refinements: match rounded pill, divider before submit button, hover/active states, reduced motion for animations.

Testing
- [ ] Lighthouse a11y score ‚â• 95 on `/watch` with and without `?q=`.
- [ ] Playwright performance check (soft): ensure suggestion response within 300ms on warm cache.
- [ ] E2E regression: run all search specs under `apps/watch-modern-e2e/src/e2e/search/` in Chromium/Firefox/WebKit.

Agent Reviews
- [ ] Tech Lead Agent: Final code review; dependency audit; feature flag plan if needed.
- [ ] Optimization Developer Agent: Bundle size deltas; confirm tree‚Äëshaking; inspect React Profiler for wasted renders.
- [ ] UX Lead Agent: Visual parity sign‚Äëoff vs. provided references.
- [ ] QA Agent: Test matrix complete (desktop/tablet/mobile, light/dark if applicable, locales).

---

## Deliverables Checklist
- [x] `SearchBar.tsx` *(Phase 1)*, `SuggestionsList.tsx` *(Phase 3)*, `suggestionsClient.ts` *(Phase 2)* in `apps/watch-modern/src/components/watch/search/`.
- [x] Refactored `VideoGrid.tsx` to consume `SearchBar` container and remove live refine. *(Phase 1)*
- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SUGGESTIONS_INDEX` defined in `.env`; add to CI secrets. QS index (or replica) to be sorted by popularity.
- [x] Curated fallback JSON: `apps/watch-modern/src/data/trending-searches.json` *(fallback only)*
- [ ] InstantSearch routing mapping `query <-> q` in provider.
- [ ] Playwright specs: `searchbar-ui.spec.ts`, `suggestions.spec.ts`, `routing.spec.ts`, updates to `grid-layout.spec.ts` selectors.
- [ ] Jest unit tests updated to mock Algolia QS client.
- [ ] RTL unit tests for search components and container logic.
- [ ] Documentation in `apps/watch-modern/SEARCH-LEARNINGS.md` updated with behavior changes.

## Rollout / Fallback
- [ ] Feature flag (optional) around new `SearchBar` container to toggle to legacy input.
- [ ] Observability: temporarily log suggestion errors and router events (remove after stabilization).

## Open Questions (to confirm before Phase 2A)
- [ ] Confirm Algolia QS index name and which popularity field is present (`popularity` vs `count`).
- [ ] Should we localize suggestions (facet by `locale`)? If yes, confirm attribute.
- [ ] Do we want Analytics time‚Äëwindowed ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù instead of static popularity? If yes, confirm worker proxy and cache time.
- [ ] Thumbnail support in suggestions? If yes, confirm source field.

## Implementation Notes / Best Practices
- ‚úÖ **Separation of concerns**: SearchBar owns input/suggestion state; grid listens only to submit events.
- ‚úÖ **Client-side only**: Suggestions fetch on client-side only (SSR-safe).
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized**: 200ms debouncing, request cancellation, 2-minute caching.
- ‚úÖ **Accessible**: Full WAI-ARIA combobox/listbox implementation.
- ‚úÖ **Type safe**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces.
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Input sanitization, length limits, control character rejection.
- ‚úÖ **Testable**: Jest unit tests with high coverage (17/18 tests passing).
- Keep public API stable and typed; prefer composition over coupling to InstantSearch hooks.

## Algolia Research Summary ‚Äî Query Suggestions & Popular Searches

- Query Suggestions index (QS)
  - Algolia builds and updates a QS index from analytics and optional sources; it‚Äôs queried with the standard Search API.
  - Typical attributes: `query` plus popularity metrics (`popularity` or `count`). Optionally, facets like `locale`, `category`, or thumbnails.
  - Typed suggestions: `index.search(partial, { hitsPerPage: 10, analytics:false, clickAnalytics:false })`.
  - Popular on focus: zero‚Äëquery search `index.search('', { hitsPerPage: 10 })` with the index (or a replica) ranked by popularity.

- Analytics API (server‚Äëside alternative)
  - Use Algolia Analytics ‚ÄúTop searches‚Äù to get time‚Äëwindowed popular queries (for example last 7/30 days). Requires Admin/Analytics key and must run server‚Äëside (Cloudflare Worker `/api/popular-searches`).
  - Response shape includes `query` and a volume metric (for example `count`). Cache at the edge for 1‚Äì6 hours.
  - Use only if QS isn‚Äôt available or when you explicitly need time‚Äëwindowed popularity/trending data.
  - Example server request (pseudo):
    - URL: `https://analytics.<region>.algolia.com/2/analytics/searches?index=<PRIMARY_INDEX>&startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD&limit=10`
    - Headers: `X-Algolia-Application-Id`, `X-Algolia-API-Key` (admin/analytics key)
    - Returns: array of `{ query, count }` (field names may vary by API version). Map to `{ text, popularity }`.

- Implementation cautions
  - Never expose Admin or Analytics keys in the browser.
  - Set `analytics:false` and `clickAnalytics:false` on suggestion requests to avoid polluting analytics.
  - Debounce keystrokes, cancel stale requests, and trim/sanitize input; enforce max length.
  - Localize with `facetFilters` if the QS index is segmented by locale.
