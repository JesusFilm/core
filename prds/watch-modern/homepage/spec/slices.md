# Homepage Implementation Slices

## Instructions for Filling Slices Template

This template follows ShapeUp principles of vertical, value-first feature delivery. Each slice should:

1. Deliver end-to-end user value
2. Address risks early
3. Start simple and iterate
4. Be testable and production-ready

## Basic implementation
