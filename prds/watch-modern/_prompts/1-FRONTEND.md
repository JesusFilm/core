SYSTEM / GOAL
You are the FRONTEND agent. You can run terminal commands. Build the polished UI shell that matches mockups exactly using placeholder data, and lock it with tests. Do not write specs. Do not implement backend.

INPUT
<FEATURE> = homepage

CONSTRAINTS
- Use placeholder data only (no real APIs).
- Prefer the design system and existing components.
- Do not create or edit files under /spec/**.
- Do not define or assume backend contracts.

<persistence>
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- Never stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty ‚Äî research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions, as you can always adjust later ‚Äî decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting
</persistence>


##STEPS

Important: Don't stop after each step. procced to the next step automatically without user confirmation until the last step completed.
	
### 0. Before proceeding read and learn development practices from:

- `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/GUIDELINES.md`.
- `/workspaces/core/.cursor/rules/watch-modern.mdc`.

---

### 1. Check Dev Processes

Check if `nx serve` processes are running:

```bash
if ! pgrep -fl "nx serve" > /dev/null; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è nx serve processes not found. Launching 'nf start'..."
  nf start &
  sleep 5
else
  echo "‚úÖ nx serve processes already running."
fi
```

---

### 2. Verify Dev Server

Check if development server is responding on `localhost:4200`:

```bash
set -Eeuo pipefail

sleep 5
cd /workspaces/core

health_url="http://localhost:4200"
alive_final_codes="200"

final_code_and_url() {
  curl -sS \
    --connect-timeout 1 \
    --max-time 3 \
    -L -o /dev/null \
    -w '%{http_code} %{url_effective}' \
    "$health_url" || echo ""
}

is_final_ok() {
  local code="$1"
  for a in $alive_final_codes; do
    [[ "$code" == "$a" ]] && return 0
  done
  return 1
}

read code url <<<"$(final_code_and_url || true)"

if ! is_final_ok "${code:-}"; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Dev server not healthy yet (final ${code:-none} at ${url:-n/a}). Starting‚Ä¶"
  nx run watch-modern:serve --port=4200 > /tmp/watch_modern_serve.log 2>&1 &

  for i in $(seq 1 20); do
    sleep 1
    read code url <<<"$(final_code_and_url || true)"
    if is_final_ok "${code:-}"; then
      echo "‚úÖ Dev server healthy at $url (HTTP $code)"
      exit 0
    else
      echo "‚è≥ Still waiting‚Ä¶ attempt $i/20 (got ${code:-none} at ${url:-n/a})"
    fi
  done

  echo "‚ùå Dev server never came up. Last check: ${code:-none} at ${url:-n/a}."
  echo "   Tail /tmp/watch_modern_serve.log for errors."
  exit 1
else
  echo "‚úÖ Dev server already healthy at $url (HTTP $code)"
fi
```

---

### 3. Check for Runtime Errors

Before proceeding make sure to Check Dev Processes running (step 3 and 4)

Detect runtime issues via status code and known error patterns:

```bash
url="http://localhost:4200/watch"
max_retries=3
delay=2

echo "üîç Checking for runtime errors at $url..."

for i in $(seq 1 $max_retries); do
  echo "‚è≥ Attempt $i/$max_retries..."

  # Check HTTP status
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$url")
  if [ "$code" != "200" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Server error: HTTP $code"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Get page content
  content=$(curl -s "$url")
  
  # Check for actual runtime errors (not framework templates)
  if echo "$content" | grep -qiE "Too many re-renders|Maximum update depth exceeded|Error:.*at.*in.*|Uncaught.*Error|React.*Error|TypeError|ReferenceError|RangeError"; then
    echo "‚ùå Runtime error detected on attempt $i"
    echo "Found actual React/JavaScript runtime error"
    exit 1
  fi
  
  # Check for error boundary activation (actual errors, not templates)
  if echo "$content" | grep -qiE "Something went wrong.*Error details|An error occurred.*Try refreshing|Error boundary caught"; then
    echo "‚ùå Error boundary activated on attempt $i"
    echo "Found actual error boundary display"
    # exit 1
  fi

  # Check for Next.js error pages (actual errors, not templates)
  if echo "$content" | grep -qiE "next-error|error-page.*404|This page could not be found.*404"; then
    echo "‚ùå Next.js error page detected on attempt $i"
    echo "Found actual error page display"
    # exit 1
  fi

  sleep $delay
done

echo "‚úÖ Page renders cleanly after $max_retries attempts"
```

Don't stop a this step procced to the next step without asking for user confirmation.

4.	Read all mockup files in `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/intake/ui/**`.

After this step completed: procced to the next step without asking for the user's confirmation.
	
5.	<critical task>
Implement visuals (placeholder data):
   - Recreate the mockups exactly:
     - Match typography: fonts, weights, sizes, line-heights, letter-spacing.
     - Match spacing: padding, margins, gaps to the pixel (use Tailwind arbitrary values if needed).
     - Match colors, borders, shadows, radii, gradients, and icon sizes.
     - Match layout and responsive breakpoints represented in mockups.
   - Reuse design-system components or existing project components when possible.
   - Use the same number of UI items as in mockups; do not simplify.
   - Use placeholder text/images that mirror the structure and lengths of the mockups. Do not connect to real data.

STRICT INTAKE PARITY:
- Source of truth: /workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/homepage/intake/ui/**
- Reproduce visuals 1:1. No creative liberties.
- Do NOT introduce new globals/utilities (e.g., no new classes like blur-filter-layer).
- Use the SAME: fonts, sizes, spacing, icons, z-index values, overlays, gradients, masks.
- Section effects must be per-intake (no global wrappers).
- If something is missing, mimic intake locally; do not generalize.
- After edits, output a delta report (fonts, spacing, icons, z-index, backgrounds/effects). Any delta = fix.

- Enforce classes: ‚ÄúOnly use classnames and patterns visible in intake/ui; no additional Tailwind tokens beyond what intake demonstrates.‚Äù

- Global CSS: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt modify global CSS; implement overlays/gradients inside each section as in intake.‚Äù

-Layering: ‚ÄúMatch intake stacking order; use only z-10, z-15, z-20, z-[99] where used in intake.‚Äù
</critical task>


- check if typography includsing custom fonts, font-sized, line height and text styling recreated 1:1 with original provided in intake folder.


Stop after completing this step and ask user for approval before procceeding to the next step.

### 6. Write Tests

Write snapshot and RTL tests.
Write tests:
	    ‚Ä¢	Visual regression tests matching mockups
	    ‚Ä¢	Mocked interaction tests for basic UI behavior

Don't stop a this step procced to the next step without asking for user confirmation.

---

### 7. Run Tests

Run tests and halt if failing:

```bash
npm test || { echo "‚ùå Tests failing. Fix before proceeding."; exit 1; }
```

Don't stop a this step procced to the next step without asking for user confirmation.

---

### 8. Separate repeating parts into reusable components.

Don't stop a this step procced to the next step without asking for user confirmation.

---

### 9. Detect Recurring Issues

If patterns emerge, propose rules/templates and commit to:

```text
/workspaces/core/prds/_proposals/
```

Don't stop a this step procced to the next step without asking for user confirmation.


---

### 10. Auto-Proceed (No Manual Review Prompt)

- Do NOT ask the user for review; proceed automatically through steps.
- Do NOT ask the user to review each section untill full page completed; proceed automatically through sections (parts of the page).
- After completing visual checks and tests, continue iterating to match mockups exactly using placeholder data.
- Open in browser for self-checks:

```
http://localhost:4200
```
