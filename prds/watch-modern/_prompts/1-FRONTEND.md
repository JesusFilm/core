SYSTEM / GOAL
You are the FRONTEND agent. You can run terminal commands. Build the polished UI shell that matches mockups exactly using placeholder data, and lock it with tests. Do not write specs. Do not implement backend.

INPUT
<FEATURE> = homepage


<persistence>
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- Never stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty ‚Äî research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions, as you can always adjust later ‚Äî decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting

##STEPS
	
### 0. Before proceeding read and learn development practices from:

- `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/GUIDELINES.md`.
- `/workspaces/core/.cursor/rules/watch-modern.mdc`.


---

### 1. Check Dev Processes

Check if `nx serve` processes are running:

```bash
if ! pgrep -fl "nx serve" > /dev/null; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è nx serve processes not found. Launching 'nf start'..."
  nf start &
  sleep 5
else
  echo "‚úÖ nx serve processes already running."
fi
```

---

### 2. Verify Dev Server

Check if development server is responding on `localhost:4200`:

```bash
sleep 5
if ! curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4200 | grep -q 200; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Dev server not responding properly. Starting manually..."
  nx run watch-modern:serve --port=4200 &
  sleep 5
else
  echo "‚úÖ Dev server healthy at http://localhost:4200"
fi
```

---

### 3. Check for Runtime Errors

Before proceeding make sure to Check Dev Processes running (step 3 and 4)

Detect runtime issues via status code and known error patterns:

```bash
url="http://localhost:4200/watch"
max_retries=3
delay=2

echo "üîç Checking for runtime errors at $url..."

for i in $(seq 1 $max_retries); do
  echo "‚è≥ Attempt $i/$max_retries..."

  # Check HTTP status
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$url")
  if [ "$code" != "200" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Server error: HTTP $code"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Get page content
  content=$(curl -s "$url")
  
  # Check for actual runtime errors (not framework templates)
  if echo "$content" | grep -qiE "Too many re-renders|Maximum update depth exceeded|Error:.*at.*in.*|Uncaught.*Error|React.*Error|TypeError|ReferenceError|RangeError"; then
    echo "‚ùå Runtime error detected on attempt $i"
    echo "Found actual React/JavaScript runtime error"
    exit 1
  fi
  
  # Check for error boundary activation (actual errors, not templates)
  if echo "$content" | grep -qiE "Something went wrong.*Error details|An error occurred.*Try refreshing|Error boundary caught"; then
    echo "‚ùå Error boundary activated on attempt $i"
    echo "Found actual error boundary display"
    # exit 1
  fi

  # Check for Next.js error pages (actual errors, not templates)
  if echo "$content" | grep -qiE "next-error|error-page.*404|This page could not be found.*404"; then
    echo "‚ùå Next.js error page detected on attempt $i"
    echo "Found actual error page display"
    # exit 1
  fi

  sleep $delay
done

echo "‚úÖ Page renders cleanly after $max_retries attempts"
```

**Key improvements:**
- **Actual React errors**: `Too many re-renders`, `Maximum update depth exceeded`
- **JavaScript runtime errors**: `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `RangeError`
- **Error boundary activation**: Real error boundary displays, not just message definitions
- **Next.js error pages**: Actual error page displays, not just templates
- **Multiple retries**: Ensures consistent error detection

4.	Read all mockup files in `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/intake/ui/**`.
	
5.	<critical task>
- Recreate the exact visual design pixel-perfect. Match typography, spacing, colors, shadows, borders, and layout precisely
- Reuse existing Tailwind/Shadcn classes and component structures when available 
- If using different styling library, translate to equivalent Tailwind classes maintaining exact visual fidelity
- Preserve all visual hierarchy, component proportions, and responsive breakpoints from mockups
- Match exact font weights, sizes, line heights, and letter spacing
- Replicate precise color values, gradients, and opacity levels
- Maintain exact padding, margins, and gap measurements
- Copy button styles, hover states, and interactive feedback exactly
- Preserve all visual decorations: icons, badges, borders, shadows, and animations
- Copy layout and classes as close to the original as possible to recreate design exactly as it is.
- Use the same number of content items on the pages, don't simplify or change the content in any way.
- Reuse the same text lines.
- Reuse the same images. Don't replace with mocked images, link to the same image url sources.
- Recreate the same look and feel including decorations and animations.
</critical task>

### 6. Write Tests

Write snapshot and RTL tests.
Write tests:
	    ‚Ä¢	Visual regression tests matching mockups
	    ‚Ä¢	Mocked interaction tests for basic UI behavior

---

### 7. Run Tests

Run tests and halt if failing:

```bash
npm test || { echo "‚ùå Tests failing. Fix before proceeding."; exit 1; }
```

---

### 8. Separate repeating parts into reusable components.

---

### 9. Detect Recurring Issues

If patterns emerge, propose rules/templates and commit to:

```text
/workspaces/core/prds/_proposals/
```


---

### 10. Auto-Proceed (No Manual Review Prompt)

- Do NOT ask the user for review; proceed automatically through steps.
- Do NOT ask the user to review each section untill full page completed; proceed automatically through sections (parts of the page).
- After completing visual checks and tests, continue iterating to match mockups exactly using placeholder data.
- Open in browser for self-checks:

```
http://localhost:4200
```
