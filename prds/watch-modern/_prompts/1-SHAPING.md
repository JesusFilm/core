INPUT  
<FEATURE>=homepage

STEPS  
1. Read all mockup files in `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/intake/ui/**`.  
2. Ask the user clarifying questions until **every** backend, state, and data-model ambiguity is resolved.  
3. Generate spec files under `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/spec/` (`pitch.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `slices.md`, optional `tasks.md`).  
   * Mark any new GraphQL schema fields under “Proposed schema changes” and ask user approval.  
4. `git add -A && git commit -m "spec($FEATURE): generated from intake mockup"`  
5. Ask: “Approve spec? yes/no” → loop if no.  
6. When approved: ask “Start BUILDER slices now?”
