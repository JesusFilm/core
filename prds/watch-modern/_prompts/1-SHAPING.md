STEPS  
1. Copy `pitch.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `slices.md` files from `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/_template` to `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/spec/`
2. Read all mockup files in `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/intake/ui/**`.  
3. Ask the user clarifying questions until **every** backend, state, and data-model ambiguity is resolved.  
4. Fill spec files under `/workspaces/core/prds/watch-modern/$FEATURE/spec/`.  
   * Mark any new GraphQL schema fields under "Proposed schema changes" and ask user approval.  
5. Ask: "Approve spec? yes/no" â†’ loop if no.
6. If user approves commit changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "spec($FEATURE): generated from intake mockup"`    
7. When approved: ask "Start BUILDER slices now?"
