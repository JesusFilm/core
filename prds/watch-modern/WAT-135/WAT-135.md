# WAT-135: Watch Site Home Page Redesign

## Overview

The Watch site home page is being redesigned to provide a new way to present existing and new content in our library through manual human curation. This redesign is being prototyped under the "Watch Modern" initiative to enhance content discovery and user engagement on the platform.

## Problem Statement

The current Watch site home page needs a new approach to presenting existing and new content in our library. A manually curated content presentation system is required to improve content discoverability, user engagement, and provide a more personalized experience for visitors exploring our video library.

## Requirements

### Development Phases

- [ ] Recreate page layout compoentent based on existing code in `core/apps/watch` 

Extract page layout patterns from `core/apps/watch/src/components/NewVideoContentPage` to create a wireframe foundation for the watch-modern home page, establishing the base page structure with header, content area, and footer.

- [ ]  Recreate header compoentent based on existing code in `core/apps/watch` 

Extract the header layout and elements from `core/apps/watch/src/components/Header`. Recreate it with the same logo and translation icon.


- [ ]  Recreate footer compoentent based on existing code in `core/apps/watch` 

Extract the footer layout and elements from `core/apps/watch/src/components/Footer`. Recreate it with the same elements.
