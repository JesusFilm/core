# Work Log

## Goals

- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles

- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions

- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage

- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows

- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals

- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy

- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps

- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.

# Collection Section Background Enhancements

## Goals

- [x] Surface collection cover imagery within section backgrounds for carousel/grid sections.

## Obstacles

- Needed to preserve the existing gradient/pattern overlay layering while introducing cover imagery.

## Resolutions

- Layered the background image beneath recreated gradient and pattern overlays to maintain readability.

## Implementation Strategy

- [x] Audit `useSectionVideoCollectionCarouselContent` to identify available collection imagery.
- [x] Expose a `backgroundImageUrl` from the hook that prefers banner art with poster fallback.
- [x] Render the background image beneath gradient + texture overlays in SectionVideoGrid and SectionVideoCarousel.
- [x] Extend unit tests to assert that background URLs render when data is available.

## Test Coverage

- `pnpm exec jest apps/watch/src/components/SectionVideoGrid/SectionVideoGrid.spec.tsx --config=apps/watch/jest.config.ts`
- `pnpm exec jest apps/watch/src/components/SectionVideoCarousel/SectionVideoCarousel.spec.tsx --config=apps/watch/jest.config.ts`

## User Flows

- Load a SectionVideoGrid fed by a collection – the collection's cover art appears behind the grid with existing overlays intact.
- Load a SectionVideoCarousel fed by the same data – the carousel inherits the same background treatment.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Consider supporting responsive art direction (mobile vs desktop) if API exposes additional image sizes.
