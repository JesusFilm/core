# Work Log

## Goals
- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles
- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions
- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows
- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals
- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps
- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.

# Felt Needs Discovery Section

## Goals
- [x] Create a felt needs discovery section on the Watch home page with preset chips, search, and Algolia-powered results.
- [x] Surface contextual share guidance that adapts to the selected chip or typed felt need.
- [x] Cover the new behaviour with unit tests and document the interaction flow.

## Obstacles
- InstantSearch state is shared across the page, so the new section had to avoid interfering with the floating search overlay.
- Needed reusable styling primitives for pill chips and slider controls without introducing new UI dependencies.

## Resolutions
- Added the section to the outer InstantSearch index and kept the floating overlay wrapped in its own `<Index>` to isolate state.
- Reused shadcn button variants and Tailwind utilities to style the chip carousel with smooth scroll helpers.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionFeltNeeds`

## User Flows
- Open Watch home → felt needs section renders with default “Anxiety” results.
- Tap a felt need chip → Algolia refines, chip highlights, share tip updates.
- Type a custom felt need → grid updates instantly and generic share guidance references the typed topic.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Source felt need options and share guidance from CMS content so they can be curated without deployments.
- Expand share tips with action-specific CTAs (watch together, send follow-up text) and localized query suggestions.
