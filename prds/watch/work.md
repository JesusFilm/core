# Work Log

## Goals

- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles

- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions

- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage

- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows

- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals

- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy

- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps

- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.

# Featured Hero Skip Control

## Goals

- [x] Add a skip control beside the preview mute toggle so users can quickly advance featured videos.
- [x] Wire the skip control into the carousel state so the next slide loads consistently.

## Implementation Strategy

- [x] Expose a `handleSkipActiveVideo` helper from `useWatchHeroCarousel` that reuses existing slide advancement logic.
- [x] Thread the handler through `WatchHero` → `VideoContentHero` → `HeroVideo` → `VideoControls` → `VideoTitle`.
- [x] Render a Skip button in the preview control cluster with translated aria label and icon-only styling.
- [x] Localize the new "Skip video" copy across existing locale bundles and extend unit coverage for the new handler.

## Obstacles

- Ensuring the skip handler cooperated with the debounced progress reset logic without regressing autoplay sequencing.

## Resolutions

- Reused the existing `moveToSlide` utility so skip events share the same scheduling + pooling behaviour as autoplay.

## Test Coverage

- `pnpm dlx nx test watch --testFile=apps/watch/src/components/VideoContentPage/VideoHero/VideoPlayer/VideoTitle/VideoTitle.spec.tsx`
- `pnpm dlx nx test watch --testFile=apps/watch/src/components/WatchHomePage/useWatchHeroCarousel.spec.tsx`

## User Flows

- Watch homepage loads → hero renders preview → user taps Skip → carousel advances immediately to the next slide.
- User taps Skip on final slide → carousel queues additional content via `moveToNext` fallback.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Consider showing a brief tooltip on first visit explaining the Skip control for accessibility.
- Evaluate whether skip interactions should emit analytics distinct from autoplay completions.
