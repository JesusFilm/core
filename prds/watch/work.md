# Work Log

## Goals
- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles
- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions
- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows
- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Watch Home Partners Section

## Goals
- [x] Introduce an "Our Partners" surface on the Watch home page that highlights partner logos.
- [x] Provide a clear call-to-action that invites visitors to become partners.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Audit the existing WatchHomePage composition to choose an insertion point for the new section.
- [x] Build a `SectionPartners` component that renders a Swiper-based carousel of partner logos, supporting copy, and a CTA button.
- [x] Add any required partner logo assets and ensure they are optimized for dark backgrounds.
- [x] Localize the section heading, description, and CTA across available `apps-watch` locales.
- [x] Render the new section within the themed portion of `WatchHomePage` alongside existing sections.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Carousel accessibility** – Ensure Swiper navigation uses `aria-label`s and alt text on logos so screen readers describe each partner.
- **Asset legibility on dark themes** – Design SVG logos with sufficient contrast when displayed on dark surfaces.
- **Layout regression** – Validate that the new section respects responsive breakpoints to avoid overflow on small screens.

## Validation Steps
- Confirm the carousel renders the expected number of partner logos and can be navigated with pointer and keyboard.
- Verify the CTA button text and link communicate the partner invitation clearly.
- Check the copy renders correctly in at least the default (English) locale and falls back gracefully elsewhere.

## Obstacles
- Updating every locale JSON manually would have been error-prone and time consuming.

## Resolutions
- Authored a small Python script to insert the new translation keys consistently across all locale files in the desired order.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionPartners`

## User Flows
- Scroll through the Our Partners carousel → inspect partner logos → activate "Become a Partner" CTA to start an email to the partnerships team.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Evaluate adding CMS-driven partner configuration so the list can be updated without code changes.
- Consider auto-scrolling the carousel when design requirements call for it.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals
- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps
- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.
