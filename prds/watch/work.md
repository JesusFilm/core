# Work Log

## Goals

- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles

- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions

- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage

- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows

- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Watch Homepage Featured Video Section

## Goals
- [x] Introduce a homepage section that highlights today's featured video with an inline player.
- [x] Surface clear metadata so viewers understand the video's length and category at a glance.
- [x] Guide viewers on how to share the featured story with friends directly from the homepage.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Create a `SectionFeaturedVideo` component that queries featured content and renders a video.js player with graceful loading states.
- [x] Present duration, video label, and contextual snippet beside the player using existing utility helpers.
- [x] Add a share guidance panel that links to the full video page and describes how to share the experience.
- [x] Integrate the section into `WatchHomePage` beneath the hero actions so it appears ahead of the collections rail.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Mux/HLS playback support**: fallback to video.js with autoplay disabled to maximise compatibility while preventing background playback surprises.
- **Missing metadata fields**: guard against absent snippet or duration data so the section can render without blocking the page.
- **Share guidance clarity**: ensure copy references existing share controls to avoid confusing users with unavailable UI.

## Validation Steps
- [x] Featured section renders on the `/watch` homepage with heading, video title, and share guidance.
- [x] Video player loads the featured stream and exposes playback controls without console errors.
- [x] Share instructions include a working link to the dedicated video page.
- [x] Unit tests cover the section's happy path rendering.

## Obstacles
- Nx `test` target currently runs the entire suite and surfaces numerous pre-existing failures (VideoCard, Header, etc.), so validated the new spec with a direct Jest invocation instead.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm exec jest --config apps/watch/jest.config.ts apps/watch/src/components/SectionFeaturedVideo/SectionFeaturedVideo.spec.tsx`

## User Flows
- Land on `/watch` → scroll through hero → encounter "Today's Featured Video" section → review metadata → play video → follow share instructions to visit the dedicated video page.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider wiring analytics events for play and share link interactions to measure engagement.
- Explore rotating multiple featured videos with tabs or carousel affordances if editorial requires more than one highlight.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals

- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy

- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps

- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas

- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.
