# Work Log

## Goals
- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles
- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions
- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows
- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals
- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps
- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.

# Homepage Country Explorer Prototype

## Goals
- [x] Add a post-tabs homepage section with an interactive world map mockup.
- [x] Surface a searchable country list that syncs with map highlighting.
- [x] Display placeholder ministry context (languages, people groups, faith background) within a templated info block.

## Obstacles
- Existing lint configuration fails globally because legacy files violate import/order and async rules.
- i18next literal-string linting required wiring every new label through translations.

## Resolutions
- Scoped the new component to translation keys in `apps-watch.json` so lint ignores literal text violations.
- Documented the global lint failures and verified the new section no longer introduces additional issues.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm dlx nx lint watch` *(fails: numerous pre-existing lint violations; no new errors from the added section)*

## User Flows
- Load homepage → scroll below video tabs → map section renders placeholder atlas summary.
- Type in search box or click quick pick → matching country highlights on the SVG map and info card refreshes with mock data.
- Click on a different country shape → map highlight moves and sidebar data updates accordingly.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Replace mock SVG outlines with production-ready GeoJSON-driven map rendering.
- Connect the search + detail panel to the planned AI API for live people group intelligence and language coverage.
- Add analytics events for map interactions to measure engagement prior to AI integration.
