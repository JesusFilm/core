# Work Log

## Goals
- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles
- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions
- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows
- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals
- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps
- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.

# Watch Home Creative Showcase Section

## Goals
- [x] Add a three-column creative showcase section that meets the embedded reference, style toggle, and language selector requirements.
- [x] Cover the interactive video switching logic with focused component tests.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Model reusable video style and language configuration objects with sensible defaults.
- [x] Build `SectionCreativeShowcase` with responsive layout, accessible controls, and deterministic data-testid hooks.
- [x] Wire the section into `WatchHomePage` and author Jest specs for style and language changes.

## Obstacles
- External sample video hosts commonly used for demos responded with 403 errors through the development proxy.

## Resolutions
- Switched to Google’s `gtv-videos-bucket` sample assets which provide stable CORS-compatible MP4 files.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm dlx jest --config apps/watch/jest.config.ts --runTestsByPath apps/watch/src/components/WatchHomePage/SectionCreativeShowcase.spec.tsx`

## User Flows
- Load the Watch homepage → scroll to the creative showcase section → tap **Cinematic** → preview swaps to the cinematic cut.
- Open the language selector → choose **Spanish** → preview updates to the Spanish animated variant.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Replace hard-coded sample assets with curated ministry-approved clips sourced from the CMS.
- Connect the section to existing localization metadata so the dropdown reflects available dubbing tracks dynamically.
