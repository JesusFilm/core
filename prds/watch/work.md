# Work Log

## Goals
- [x] Extend section video slides with container and variant metadata plus video snapshot.
- [x] Refactor carousel and grid components to consume enriched slide data directly.
- [x] Update unit tests to validate new slide shape.

## Obstacles
- Jest hoisted mocks disallow referencing captured variables directly inside module factories.
- Icon components pulled heavy MUI SVG helpers into tests, causing JSX transform warnings.

## Resolutions
- Renamed mock trackers to `mock*` prefixes to satisfy Jest's lazy evaluation guard.
- Mocked `@core/shared/ui/icons/Icon` within specs to bypass SVG creation.

## Test Coverage
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoCarousel SectionVideoGrid`
- `pnpm test watch -- SectionVideoGrid`

## User Flows
- Render SectionVideoCarousel -> Apollo data resolves -> slides provide snapshot -> VideoCard uses container slug for href.
- Render SectionVideoGrid -> slides map to VideoGrid -> cards display enriched video data.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Share a typed helper for reusing the slide-to-video snapshot logic in other sections.
- Consider centralizing Jest icon mocks to reduce repetition.

# Download Dialog Subtitle Downloads

## Goals
- [x] Enable Watch download dialog to offer subtitle files alongside video downloads.
- [x] Provide clear user guidance for pairing downloaded videos with subtitle tracks.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Load subtitle metadata on demand with the existing `GET_SUBTITLES` query when the subtitle tab becomes active.
- [x] Refactor `DownloadDialog` with a tabbed layout separating video and subtitle assets.
- [x] Surface subtitle download actions with language labels and sanitized default file names.
- [x] Add in-dialog instructions describing how to load subtitle files during playback.
- [x] Update translations and unit tests covering the new subtitle workflow.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Subtitle inventory may be large; guard rendering with graceful empty states and virtualization not required for current counts.
- Terms-of-use acceptance should remain intact for video downloads; subtitle actions can stay independent to avoid blocking access when not mandated.

## Obstacles
- Integrating Apollo's lazy query introduced provider requirements in existing unit tests.

## Resolutions
- Wrapped the dialog in `MockedProvider` and supplied `GET_SUBTITLES` mocks to satisfy subtitle-loading tests without network access.

## Validation Steps
- [x] Video downloads continue to function across qualities after accepting the terms.
- [x] Subtitle tab lists available languages and downloads the expected file URLs.
- [x] Instructions render within the modal with accessible text for screen readers.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Investigate bundling selected subtitles with a pre-packaged player experience for offline audiences.
- Explore remembering the last-downloaded subtitle language for quicker repeat access.

# Search Component Overlay Refactor

## Goals
- Extract floating search overlay logic into a reusable hook.
- Split SearchComponent presentation into focused view components.
- Add automated coverage for overlay focus management and trending fallback behaviour.

## Implementation Strategy
- [x] Audit current SearchComponent responsibilities and identify logic to move into a hook.
- [x] Create `useFloatingSearchOverlay` hook to manage search state, focus handling, and trending fetch lifecycle.
- [x] Extract `CategoryGrid`, `QuickList`, and overlay result layouts into standalone components in `SearchComponent/`.
- [x] Update `SearchComponent.tsx` to consume the hook and render the new presentational pieces, keeping the file under 150 lines.
- [x] Author unit tests for the hook (focus/closing) and components (trending fallback, layout rendering).
- [x] Run lint/test suite relevant to the watch app and ensure clean git status.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Radix dialog focus trapping** could swallow blur events. Mitigate by unit tests that exercise blur handlers through the hook.
- **Trending API failures** must fall back to translations. Cover with tests that simulate hook error state.
- Ensure Algolia refine resets correctly when overlay closes via Escape or blur.

## Validation Steps
- Overlay opens on input focus and auto-focuses the search field.
- Quick select chips trigger new search and keep overlay open.
- Trending list falls back to translated defaults on fetch error.
- Tests for new hook/components pass.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider moving category metadata to CMS-driven config if design requires frequent updates.
- Evaluate migrating remaining MUI layout primitives to Tailwind equivalents in a future iteration.
