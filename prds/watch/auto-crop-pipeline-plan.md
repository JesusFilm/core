## Milestone 0 — Foundations & Tooling
- [x] Confirm decoding/rendering toolchain (WebCodecs or ffmpeg.wasm) and document constraints.
- [x] Audit current workers/hooks for reuse (e.g., `scene-detection.worker.ts`, `use-video.ts`), note required refactors.
- [x] Establish shared type definitions (`VideoMetadata`, `VirtualCameraKeyframe`, etc.) in a common package.
- [x] Stand up profiling/benchmark harness to record frame processing time per stage.

### Shared Types Library
Created `libs/shared/video-processing` library with comprehensive type definitions aligned with two-pass pipeline architecture:

**Core Types:**
- `VideoMetadata` - Video properties (dimensions, fps, duration, codecs, etc.)
- `VirtualCameraKeyframe` - Individual crop window definitions with timing
- `VirtualCameraPath` - Complete camera movement path with metadata
- `FaceDetection` & `TrackedFace` - Face detection and tracking results
- `ShotBoundary` - Scene change detection results
- `CropPath` & `RenderingConfig` - Output path and rendering specifications
- **`AnalysisResult`** - First pass output (metadata + shots + face tracking + camera path)
- **`PipelineConfig`** - Complete two-pass pipeline configuration
- **`PipelineProgress`** - Progress tracking for both passes

**Default Configurations (Battle-tested parameters):**
- `DEFAULT_OUTPUT_TARGET` - 1080×1920 @ 30fps target specs
- `DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_CAMERA_PARAMS` - 1-Euro filter (center β=0.15, zoom β=0.25), dead-zone 12%×10%, face height 35%
- `DEFAULT_FACE_TRACKING_CONFIG` - Detector cadence k=3, confidence decay 0.95
- `DEFAULT_SCENE_DETECTION_CONFIG` - Histogram/SSIM diff every 3 frames
- `DEFAULT_RENDERING_CONFIG` - H.264 High profile @ 8-12Mbps, keyframe interval 2s
- `DEFAULT_PIPELINE_CONFIG` - Complete pipeline config with worker settings
- `DEFAULT_PROFILING_CONFIG` - Performance monitoring settings

**Two-Pass Pipeline Structure:**
- **Analysis Pass**: Probe → Shot Detection → Face Tracking → Path Generation → Smoothing
- **Render Pass**: Path JSON → Frame Cropping → Scaling → Encoding
- **Path JSON as Single Source of Truth** - Export/import for manual overrides

### Profiling & Benchmarking Harness
Implemented `VideoProcessingProfiler` class with comprehensive performance monitoring:

**Features:**
- **Session-based profiling** - Track complete pipeline runs with metadata
- **Stage-level measurements** - Time individual operations (detection, tracking, rendering)
- **Memory profiling** - Monitor heap usage and memory deltas
- **Hardware detection** - Browser, WebGL, WebAssembly, hardware concurrency
- **Multiple export formats** - JSON, CSV, console logging
- **Performance reports** - Bottleneck analysis and optimization recommendations

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { profiling } from '@core/shared/video-processing'

// Profile a complete pipeline run
const sessionId = profiling.startPipeline(videoId, { duration, width, height })

// Profile individual operations
await profiling.profileAsync('face_detection', async () => {
  // Face detection logic
})

profiling.profileSync('path_generation', () => {
  // Path generation logic
})

profiling.endPipeline(sessionId)

// Export results
console.log(profiling.exportData('console'))
```

**Integration Points:**
- Automatically tracks video metadata, processing parameters, and environment
- Provides real-time performance feedback during development
- Generates optimization recommendations based on bottlenecks
- Supports A/B testing of different algorithm configurations

### Alignment with Global Plan ✅

**Excellent Alignment:**
- **Two-pass architecture** - Types explicitly model analysis pass → path JSON → render pass
- **Battle-tested parameters** - All defaults match global plan specifications exactly
- **Path JSON as source of truth** - `CropPath` interface designed for export/import/overrides
- **1-Euro filter** - Documented in `VirtualCameraParameters` smoothing section
- **Dead-zone + smoothing** - 12%×10% dead-zone, β=0.15/0.25 smoothing parameters
- **Face tracking cadence** - k=3 frames with confidence decay and primary face arbitration
- **Shot boundary detection** - Histogram/SSIM diff sampling every 2-3 frames

**Additional Edge Cases Covered:**
- Multi-face arbitration with sticky threshold and sustained dominance rules
- Profile turns/occlusion handling via confidence decay and framing widening
- Camera motion detection for sports/high-motion content
- 4K source handling with pixel density limits and 1.25× upscale caps

### Toolchain Analysis
**Current Video Processing Setup:**
- **Playback:** Video.js (v8.17.4) with HLS/MP4 support via `use-video.ts` hook
- **Frame Capture:** Canvas-based via `captureVideoThumbnail()` in `video-utils.ts`
- **Detection:** MediaPipe Tasks Vision (v0.10.22-rc) for face/object detection
- **Workers:** `detection.worker.ts`, `scene-detection.worker.ts` (processing), `ffmpeg.worker.ts` (mock export simulation)
- **No WebCodecs or ffmpeg.wasm currently implemented**

**Constraints & Recommendations:**
- WebCodecs not available - would require significant refactor to replace canvas-based frame capture
- ffmpeg.wasm not implemented - current "ffmpeg" worker is just progress simulation
- Current setup limits to browser-compatible video formats (MP4, HLS)
- Frame extraction via canvas is synchronous and blocking - may need optimization for high frame rates

### Worker/Hook Audit for Reuse
**Existing Components:**
- **`detection.worker.ts`**: MediaPipe face/object detection with face tracking logic - can be reused/extended for auto-crop face detection
- **`scene-detection.worker.ts`**: Advanced scene change detection with WebGL GPU acceleration - can be reused for shot boundary detection
- **`use-video.ts`**: Video.js playback hook with HLS/MP4 support - can be reused for video loading/playback
- **`use-scene-detection.ts`**: Real-time scene detection hook with canvas frame extraction - can be adapted for analysis pipeline
- **`ffmpeg.worker.ts`**: Mock export worker - needs replacement with actual ffmpeg.wasm or WebCodecs implementation

**Required Refactors for Auto-Crop Pipeline:**
- Extend `detection.worker.ts` with configurable face detection cadence (k=3 frames) and primary face scoring
- Adapt `scene-detection.worker.ts` for histogram/SSIM diff sampling instead of continuous analysis
- Enhance `use-video.ts` to support frame-by-frame seeking for analysis passes
- Create new `use-video-probe.ts` hook for metadata extraction (width, height, fps, duration, rotation, audio)
- Implement `VirtualCameraPath` generation logic integrating face tracking + scene boundaries
- Add `VideoMetadata` persistence alongside video references for debug exports

## Milestone 1 — Analysis Pass (Frame Intelligence) ✅ COMPLETED
### Step 1: Ingest & Probe ✅

### Step 2: Shot Boundary Detection ✅
- [x] Implement histogram / SSIM diff routine sampling every 2–3 frames.

- ✅ Exponential smoothing with configurable parameters matching global plan defaults

### Step 6: Edge Handling & Events ✅
**Implementation:** Transition state management with `CameraTransition` types

- ✅ Shot boundary detection integration prevents pan across cuts (core global plan requirement)

**Transition Types Implemented:**
- `hard_cut`: Instant transition at scene boundaries with filter reset
- `face_swap`: Smooth 8-frame ease for primary face changes within same shot
