      "This film is a perfect introduction to Jesus through the Gospel of Luke. Jesus constantly surprises and confounds people, from His miraculous birth to His rise from the grave. Follow His life through excerpts from the Book of Luke, all the miracles, the teachings, and the passion. \n\nGod creates everything and loves mankind. But mankind disobeys God. God and mankind are separated, but God loves mankind so much, He arranges redemption for mankind. He sends his Son Jesus to be a perfect sacrifice to make amends for us.\n\nBefore Jesus arrives, God prepares mankind. Prophets speak of the birth, the life, and the death of Jesus.\n\nJesus attracts attention. He teaches in parables no one really understands, gives sight to the blind, and helps those who no one sees as worth helping.\n\nHe scares the Jewish leaders, they see him as a threat. So they arrange, through Judas the traitor and their Roman oppressors, for the crucifixion of Jesus. They think the matter is settled. But the women who serve Jesus discover an empty tomb. The disciples panic. When Jesus appears, they doubt He's real. But it's what He proclaimed all along: He is their perfect sacrifice, their Savior, victor over death. He ascends to heaven, telling His followers to tell others about Him and His teachings."

And the boat starts to take on water.\n\nThe whole time, Jesus stays asleep. The disciples hold on tight. They try to keep the boat afloat. Finally, Peter cries out to the still sleeping Jesus. He tells Jesus that the boat is taking on water and that they'll all be drowned.\n\nJesus stands and puts a hand out toward the storm. The storm clears. And the seas immediately calm."

Jesus is lifted high in the air. He hangs on the cross, tired and in pain. He prays for those in the crowd. He asks God to forgive them because they don't know what they do.\n\nThe crowd murmurs at the feet of the cross. Annas and Caiaphas comment that He saved others. They wonder why He doesn't save Himself. The crowd starts to jeer. They urge Him to save Himself. But He doesn't."

      "Luke's Gospel, more than any other, fits the category of ancient biography. Luke acts as a 'narrator' of events rather than the conventional author, painting a picture of Jesus as a very human character, full of compassion for all the suffering world. Luke sees Jesus as the 'Savior' of all people irrespective of their beliefs, always on the side of the needy and the deprived against the rich and the powerful. He constantly challenges those in power for their self-righteousness. This film about the life of Jesus takes the actual Gospel text as it's script, word-for-word, unedited. Five years in the making, this epic production has been critically acclaimed by leading religious scholars as a unique and highly authentic telling of the Jesus story. \n \nFor more information please visit: https://lumoproject.com/\nFollow us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/thelumoproject\nFollow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/TheLumoProject"

      "This film is a perfect introduction to Jesus through the Gospel of Luke. Jesus constantly surprises and confounds people, from His miraculous birth to His rise from the grave. Follow His life through excerpts from the Book of Luke, all the miracles, the teachings, and the passion. \n\nGod creates everything and loves mankind. But mankind disobeys God. God and mankind are separated, but God loves mankind so much, He arranges redemption for mankind. He sends his Son Jesus to be a perfect sacrifice to make amends for us.\n\nBefore Jesus arrives, God prepares mankind. Prophets speak of the birth, the life, and the death of Jesus.\n\nJesus attracts attention. He teaches in parables no one really understands, gives sight to the blind, and helps those who no one sees as worth helping.\n\nHe scares the Jewish leaders, they see him as a threat. So they arrange, through Judas the traitor and their Roman oppressors, for the crucifixion of Jesus. They think the matter is settled. But the women who serve Jesus discover an empty tomb. The disciples panic. When Jesus appears, they doubt He's real. But it's what He proclaimed all along: He is their perfect sacrifice, their Savior, victor over death. He ascends to heaven, telling His followers to tell others about Him and His teachings.",

      "Jesus gets into a boat and tells His disciples they should all go to the other side of the lake. Along the way, Jesus falls asleep. A storm starts to rage. Waves stretch high over the bow. And the boat starts to take on water.\n\nThe whole time, Jesus stays asleep. The disciples hold on tight. They try to keep the boat afloat. Finally, Peter cries out to the still sleeping Jesus. He tells Jesus that the boat is taking on water and that they'll all be drowned.\n\nJesus stands and puts a hand out toward the storm. The storm clears. And the seas immediately calm.",

      "They arrive at the place where the crosses are being set up. Others are being tied to their crosses. Jesus is stripped and led to His own cross. They throw Him down on it. There are cries as the others are nailed to their crosses.\n\nThe nails are hammered through Jesus's wrists and feet as He screams. Then slowly, the crosses are erected as Romans pulls the ropes. Jesus is lifted high in the air. He hangs on the cross, tired and in pain. He prays for those in the crowd. He asks God to forgive them because they don't know what they do.\n\nThe crowd murmurs at the feet of the cross. Annas and Caiaphas comment that He saved others. They wonder why He doesn't save Himself. The crowd starts to jeer. They urge Him to save Himself. But He doesn't.",
