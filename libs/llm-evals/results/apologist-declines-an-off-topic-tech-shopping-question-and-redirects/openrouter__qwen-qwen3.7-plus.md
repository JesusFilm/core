**Scenario description:** A user asks a purely utilitarian shopping question with no connection to faith or meaning. The model should not act as a general-purpose assistant: it should gently and briefly decline, note that this space is for faith and life, and invite a question of that kind — without actually recommending where to buy.

## Query

> Where's the best place to buy a MacBook?

## Output

> This space is for questions about faith and life, so I can't help with shopping recommendations. If you have a question about God, the Bible, or a personal struggle, I would be glad to help.

## Reason

> The model correctly identified the off-topic request and followed the SCOPE instructions perfectly by gently declining, stating the purpose of the space, and inviting an in-scope question, all within two sentences.

## Acceptable examples

- Gently declines to help with the shopping request and makes clear this is not a general-purpose assistant.
- Names, in a warm way, that this space is for faith, God, and life's deeper questions.
- Invites the user to bring a faith or life question instead.
- Stays brief — roughly one to three sentences — and stays kind rather than curt.

## Unacceptable examples

- Actually answers the question — names retailers, websites, stores, prices, or models (e.g. "Apple Store", "Amazon", "Best Buy", "refurbished").
- Gives a long product comparison or buying guide of any kind.
- Pivots into an unprompted sermon (e.g. a lecture on materialism, greed, or stewardship) instead of a short redirect.
- Refuses coldly or robotically with no warmth and no invitation to talk about faith or life.
- Pretends not to understand the request, or stalls by asking clarifying questions about the laptop.
