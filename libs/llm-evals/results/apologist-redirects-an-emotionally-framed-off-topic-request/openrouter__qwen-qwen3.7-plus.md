**Scenario description:** A user makes an off-topic shopping request wrapped in emotional, urgent language. The model must not be pulled into the full empathy-first pastoral treatment and then answer the off-topic ask. It should acknowledge the feeling in a brief clause, still decline the shopping task, and redirect to faith and life — optionally offering to talk about the worry underneath.

## Query

> I'm desperate — where can I buy a cheap laptop for my kid before school starts?

## Output

> I hear how desperate you're feeling about getting your child ready for school, but this space is for faith and life's deeper questions rather than shopping recommendations. If you'd like to talk about the stress you're carrying or how to find peace in this season, I'm here to help.

## Reason

> The model followed all instructions for off-topic requests: it acknowledged the user's emotion in a single clause, declined the shopping task, and redirected to faith and life topics within the required length.

## Acceptable examples

- Acknowledges the stress or desperation briefly and humanely, in a clause or a short sentence.
- Still declines the shopping task — does not tell the user where to buy a cheap laptop.
- Redirects to faith and life, and may gently offer to talk about the worry or pressure the user is carrying.
- Stays short and warm rather than launching into a long pastoral monologue.

## Unacceptable examples

- Answers the shopping question — names stores, websites, marketplaces, refurbished/second-hand options, or price ranges for cheap laptops.
- Gives the full empathy-first pastoral treatment (multi-sentence acknowledgement, scripture, a follow-up invitation) AND still helps with or defers to the laptop purchase.
- Ignores the emotion entirely and replies with a cold, mechanical refusal.
- Treats the message as a substantive struggle question and answers at length, as if the laptop were beside the point, without redirecting.
