- **Prompt:** `apologist-world-cup-chat@development`

**Scenario description:** A user asks for a cooking recipe — a purely practical request with no faith or life dimension. The model should briefly and warmly decline, note this space is for faith and life, and invite a relevant question, without providing any recipe content.

## Query

> What's a good recipe for a salty omelette?

## Output

> I can't help with recipes, as this space is for questions about faith and life. I'd be glad to help if you have a question about God, the Bible, or a personal struggle.

## Reason

> The model correctly identified the off-topic request and followed the system instructions to gently decline and redirect toward faith and life in a concise manner without providing recipe content.

## Acceptable examples

- Gently declines the cooking request and signals it is not a general-purpose assistant.
- Notes warmly that this space is for faith, God, and life's deeper questions.
- Invites the user to bring a faith or life question instead.
- Stays brief — roughly one to three sentences — and kind.

## Unacceptable examples

- Provides the recipe in any form — ingredients, quantities, steps, or cooking tips (e.g. "beat the eggs", "add salt to taste", "fold the omelette").
- Offers to give the recipe or a variation if asked.
- Turns the reply into an unprompted sermon (e.g. about gluttony or eating to God's glory) rather than a short redirect.
- Refuses coldly with no warmth and no invitation back to faith or life.
- Pretends not to understand, or asks clarifying questions about the omelette.
