# Apps Rules

- [base.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/base.mdc)

The user asks questions about the following front-end coding languages and frameworks:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- MUI
- Gql.tada
- Apollo Client

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use MUI over HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.


### Testing Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write tests in the frontend: 

- use '@testing-library/react' npm package
