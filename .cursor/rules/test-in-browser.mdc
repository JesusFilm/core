# Browser Testing with Playwright MCP

When implementing new features or investigating bugs, always test in a real browser environment using Playwright MCP to simulate authentic human user interactions.

## Core Testing Requirements

### 1. Real User Simulation
- Use actual mouse clicks, keyboard input, and scroll behaviors
- Test with realistic timing delays between actions
- Simulate different user interaction patterns (power users vs casual users)
- Include edge cases like rapid clicking, incomplete form submissions, or navigation interruptions

### 2. Cross-Device Testing
- Test on multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify touch interactions work on mobile viewports
- Test keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- Ensure responsive design works across breakpoints

### 3. Feature-Specific Testing Patterns

#### For New Features:
- Test the complete user flow from entry point to completion
- Verify all interactive elements respond correctly
- Test error states and edge cases
- Validate loading states and transitions
- Ensure feature works with existing functionality

#### For Bug Investigation:
- Reproduce the exact steps that cause the bug
- Test variations of the problematic flow
- Verify the fix doesn't break related functionality
- Test with different data states (empty, populated, edge cases)
