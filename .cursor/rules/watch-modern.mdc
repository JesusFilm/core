# Watch-Modern Rules

- @base.mdc

## Stack

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn
- Gql.tada
- Apollo Client

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Prefer shadcn/ui components over custom implementations or raw HTML elements. If a shadcn/ui component does not exist, use semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS, and document the reason.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- “All components and functions must be fully typed with TypeScript.”


### Testing Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write tests in the frontend: 

- use '@testing-library/react' npm package


## Documentation Guidelines

- All components must have JSDoc comments, including examples and prop documentation.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
